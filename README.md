- [**Chatalet**](https://github.com/prikarsartam/Chatalet) concerns abstractive text summarisation with multilabel classification with further plan to create a *allure-filter* to integrate with it for enticing headline generation.

- [**Jokerman**](https://github.com/prikarsartam/Jokerman) is a text classification system to determine the level semantic integrety in a syntagma.

- [Ising_Monte-Carlo](https://github.com/prikarsartam/Statistical-Spin-System-Simulation-using-MonteCarlo-Algorithm) uses random number generation method to determine the ground point configuration of a 2D classical 2-level interactive spin system with distinguishing the phase-transition structure underneath and numerically extrapolating the critical exponents for the system at the criticality. 

- [**Drone-Control**](https://github.com/prikarsartam/Drone-Control) is a software backup for very simple hardware setup for BLDC drones with NODEMCU/ESP32 integrated single *flight controller + receiver* module including 4-channel [*WebSocket*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) included JavaScript remote controller for universal and reliable communication.
