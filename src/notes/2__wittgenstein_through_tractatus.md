# Wittgenstein Through *Tractatus*: A Journey from the Symbolic to the Real

## 1. Abstract: The Logical Architecture of Reality
The *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus* is not merely a treatise on logic; it is an attempt to define the boundary between sense and nonsense, and in doing so, to delimit the sphere of the "Real." Wittgenstein’s journey begins with a rigorous symbolic isomorphism between language and the world and ends in a profound silence regarding the most important aspects of human existence—ethics, aesthetics, and the mystical.

> [!IMPORTANT] The Core Thesis
> Language and reality share a common logical form. Language pictures the world. However, the logical form itself cannot be described *within* language; it can only be *shown*. This distinction between **saying** (*sagen*) and **showing** (*zeigen*) is the cardinal problem of philosophy.

---

## 2. The Symbolic Foundation: Logical Atomism
The *Tractatus* opens with a metaphysical vision of the world as a totality of facts, not things. The symbolic representation of the world is grounded in **Logical Atomism**.

### 2.1 The Ontology of Facts
Wittgenstein asserts that the world is determined by the facts, and by their being *all* the facts.
*   **The World**: "The world is all that is the case" (1).
*   **Facts**: The world divides into facts (*Tatsachen*), which are the existence of atomic states of affairs (*Sachverhalten*) (2).
*   **Objects**: States of affairs are combinations of objects (*Gegenstände*). Objects are simple, unalterable, and subsistent; they form the "substance" of the world (2.021).

> [!NOTE] Substance as Form
> Objects are not physical things like chairs or atoms; they are the purely logical constituents that make up the form of the world. They are "colorless" and exist only in the potential for combination [Wittgenstein's Logical Atomism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein-atomism/).

### 2.2 The Picture Theory of Meaning
How does the "Symbolic" connect to the "Real"? Wittgenstein proposes the **Picture Theory**. A proposition is a logical picture of a state of affairs.
*   **Isomorphism**: For a proposition to have sense, there must be a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the proposition (names) and the elements of reality (objects).
*   **Logical Form**: What a picture must have in common with reality in order to be able to depict it—correctly or incorrectly—is its logical form (2.18).

This leads to a rigorous definition of truth: A proposition is true if the state of affairs it depicts actually obtains in the world.

## 3. The Mathematical Generalization
Wittgenstein seeks the general form of any possible proposition—the "essence" of language.

### 3.1 Truth-Functions and the N-Operator
He argues that all complex propositions are built from elementary propositions via truth-functional operations. He introduces the **Sheffer Stroke** (or joint negation) as the fundamental operation.
If we have a set of propositions $\xi$, the operation $N(\xi)$ is the negation of all propositions in that set.

> [!TIP] The Universal Operator
> Every logical operation (AND, OR, NOT, IF-THEN) can be constructed using only the operator $N(\xi)$ (neither... nor...). This suggests that logic is a closed, self-contained system generated by a single rule.

### 3.2 The General Form of a Proposition
The most profound mathematical insight in the *Tractatus* is the recursive formula for all meaningful language (6):

$$ [\bar{p}, \bar{\xi}, N(\bar{\xi})] $$

Where:
*   $\bar{p}$ represents the totality of elementary propositions.
*   $\bar{\xi}$ represents any set of propositions selected from the previous stage.
*   $N(\bar{\xi})$ represents the operation of joint negation applied to that set.

This formula asserts that **all meaningful language** is merely the result of successive truth-functional applications to atomic facts [The theory of elementary propositions](https://www3.nd.edu/~jspeaks/courses/2007-8/43904/_HANDOUTS/wittgenstein-elementary-propositions.pdf).

## 4. The Bridge: The Limits of Language
The rigorous application of this symbolic logic leads to startling boundaries. If meaningful language is restricted to pictures of facts, then anything that is *not* a fact cannot be said.

### 4.1 Saying vs. Showing
This is the pivot point of the *Tractatus*.
*   **Said**: Propositions describing facts (natural science).
*   **Shown**: The logical form of the world, which allows propositions to make sense, cannot itself be the subject of a proposition. "What can be shown, cannot be said" (4.1212) [The Place of Saying and Showing In Wittgenstein's Tractatus](https://aporia.byu.edu/pdfs/pulido-saying_and_showing_in_wittgenstein.pdf).

### 4.2 Solipsism and the Metaphysical Subject
Wittgenstein pushes the limit of language to the limit of the self.
"The limits of my language mean the limits of my world" (5.6).
The subject is not a part of the world but its limit—like the eye, which sees the visual field but is not contained within it.

> [!WARNING] The Shrinking Self
> Solipsism, when strictly thought out, coincides with pure realism. The metaphysical self shrinks to a point without extension, and there remains only the reality coordinated with it (5.64) [The Metaphysical Subject and Logical Space](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opphil-2018-0020/html).

---

## 5. The Real: The Mystical and the Silence
Having defined the symbolic (what can be said), Wittgenstein reveals that the "Real"—the things that truly matter—lies outside it.

### 5.1 Ethics and Aesthetics
Because ethics and aesthetics do not describe facts (states of affairs), they are **transcendental** (6.421).
*   A murder is a fact; the "wrongness" of the murder is not a fact in the world but a value outside it.
*   "Ethics and aesthetics are one." They view the world *sub specie aeternitatis* (under the aspect of eternity).

> [!CAUTION] The Ineffable
> We feel that even if *all* possible scientific questions be answered, the problems of life have still not been touched at all (6.52). The sense of the world must lie outside the world [Ethics, Aesthetics and Religion: Kant at the Limits of Language](https://www.institutuldefilosofie.ro/request.php?2078).

### 5.2 The Mystical (*Das Mystische*)
The mystical is not *how* the world is (the facts), but *that* it is (6.44). The very existence of the world is the miracle that cannot be captured by the symbolic formula $[\bar{p}, \bar{\xi}, N(\bar{\xi})]$.

### 5.3 The Ladder and the Silence
The book concludes with a paradox. The propositions of the *Tractatus* themselves attempt to say what can only be shown. Therefore, they are strictly nonsense (*unsinnig*), but illuminating nonsense.

> [!QUOTE] The Ladder Metaphor (6.54)
> "My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as nonsense, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them. (He must so to speak throw away the ladder, after he has climbed up on it.)"

The journey ends not with a new theory, but with the cessation of philosophy.

> [!DONE] The Final Limit (7)
> "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent."

## 6. Notable Examples and Applications

| Concept | The Symbolic (Saying) | The Real (Showing) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logic** | The tautologies of notation (e.g., $p \lor \neg p$). | The structural scaffolding of the universe. |
| **Ethics** | "You should not steal" (treated as a fact/command). | The absolute value of the act, seen from outside time. |
| **The Self** | The psychological human being (a fact). | The metaphysical subject (the limit of the world). |
| **Music/Art** | The score, the sound waves (facts). | The aesthetic emotion, the "internal" melody. |

> [!EXAMPLE] The "Eye" Analogy
> Just as the eye is the condition for the visual field but is not seen within it, the "transcendental subject" is the condition for the world but is not found in the world. This illustrates why psychology (study of the person) is distinct from philosophy (study of the limit).

## Summary
The *Tractatus* travels from a rigid mathematical formalism ($[\bar{p}, \bar{\xi}, N(\bar{\xi})]$) to a profound resignation. It establishes the symbolic to protect the Real; by ruthlessly defining what can be said (science/facts), Wittgenstein secures a silent, untouchable space for what matters most (ethics/value).
