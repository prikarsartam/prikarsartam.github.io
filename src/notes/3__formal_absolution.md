## The Formalism of Thought, Language as Criticality, and the Emergence of Consciousness

Hilbert first introduced the idea of an absolute proof by which consistency of a system can be investigated without invoking consistency of any other system, which advocated complete drainage of interpretation-sensitive meaning from the system, and binding it in terms of empty signs with rules for manipulation. A complete formalization of a deducible system was aimed in this context where strings of meaningless symbols represented expressions within that system, like postulates and theorems. Deducible expressions carry equivalent information, thus processes in the system correspond to the transformation of one symbolic sequence to another. In this [foundational vision](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hilbert-program/), the geometric structure of formal deduction could be mapped—each axiom and theorem as nodes in a graph, with proofs as traversals between them, where the minimal number of inference steps required to transform one expression into another corresponds to the edge distance between nodes in this formal system graph (G). However, [Gödel's incompleteness theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems) demonstrated that no consistent formal system rich enough to express arithmetic can be both complete and decidable. This fundamental limitation reveals that absolute proof divorced from external interpretation is impossible—the system cannot prove its own consistency, nor can it capture all truths within its domain. The usage of language within this species we belong is to increase the efficiency of coordination of its parts, which are two individuals during an exchange of verbal expression. We must not ignore the restriction that language is heavily utilized in communication, and it is the individual that uses it. The innate characteristics of the I reflects necessary and sufficient conditions for language to be used.

Criticality as inclination towards more unambiguous language, in order to communicate with least loss of information, or least dissipation. [Bayesian surprise](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2860069/), quantified as the divergence between prior and posterior beliefs, attracts 72-84% of human gaze shifts and attention. In information-theoretic terms, [Shannon entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_\(information_theory\)) provides the mathematical foundation: the minimum number of bits required to encode a message equals the negative expectation of log-probability across all possible symbols. Language evolution towards decreased ambiguity reflects a system approaching criticality—a state where information can propagate across arbitrary range with minimal dissipation, analogous to how [phase transitions in complex networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_a_random_network) enable sudden emergence of giant connected components. ​

When conveying a theory of thought, the questions like which discipline it belongs within, has to meet with the universality of thought, i.e. every possible human construct, from the formal logical paradigm, unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in natural science to the societal power hierarchy falls following to the emergence of thought in this solar system. What can thought do, i.e. all its range of functionalities, must encompass what it accomplished (in the course of evolution), say the theory of fundamental particles; being a manifestation of thought which guided the knowledgeable guesses verified with the accompaniment from empirical results. The first encounter a mind does with reality is via the perception of reality it perceives within, as a perception or a thought.

## Apparent Independence and the Paradox of Self-Organization

Life can be regarded as an infinite game, where its purpose is to keep the system alive; or in other words, the point of life is to continue it. Self-organized criticality in biological and physical systems—exemplified by the [Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld sandpile model](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0256-307X/32/9/094501)—demonstrates how systems automatically converge to a critical state where each perturbation may trigger avalanches of any size, distributed according to power-law statistics. This occurs without external fine-tuning; the dynamics of adding and dissipating matter at boundaries naturally drives the system to criticality, where scale-free correlations emerge spontaneously. The system maintains apparent independence in its local topology while exhibiting global coordination through long-range correlations characteristic of critical phenomena. ​

## Chomsky's Innatism and Universal Grammar as Evolutionary Constraint

Chomsky's innatism and Universal Grammar pose a methodological paradox: we study natural phenomena through the empirical methods of science, yet human higher cognitive faculties—particularly language—seem to require what borders on metaphysical explanation. Chomsky resolves this by arguing that Universal Grammar is indeed a necessary genetic requirement for language acquisition, encoded in the specific neural architecture of the human brain. This is not mystical but rather the inevitable consequence of evolutionary constraints: we possess hands rather than wings because of selective pressures on our ancestors; similarly, we possess a language faculty rather than the capacity for arbitrary communication systems. This genetic scaffolding is not in conflict with materialism—it is simply the physical realization of cumulative evolutionary advantage, a "transition rule of our physiological automaton," as it were. ​

## Graph Structure of Formal Systems and Hyperbolic Geometry

In formal system graphs where nodes represent expressions and edges represent deduction steps, the distance between any two expressions measures the minimal inference chain connecting them. When considering networks with power-law degree distributions—where a small number of nodes possess vastly more connections than the typical node—the underlying geometry is naturally [hyperbolic rather than Euclidean]. In hyperbolic metric spaces, the exponential growth property enables these networks to embed hierarchical, tree-like structures with high clustering, generating scale-free networks without artificial constraints. The conjecture that such formal graphs possess hyperbolic metric structure is compelling: formal systems with axioms at the "root" and increasingly remote theorems at the "leaves" naturally exhibit the hierarchical clustering and power-law connectivity of hyperbolic geometry. For any quadruplet of expressions (a,b,c,d), the four pairwise distances satisfy the hyperbolic inequality: 2δ ≥ [d(a,b)+d(c,d)] − [d(a,c)+d(b,d)], where δ characterizes the curvature. This inequality may provide a tractable bound on the complexity of formal deduction paths. ​

The concept of "apparent independence" emerges in hyperbolic geometry through the parallel postulate of non-Euclidean space: infinitely many hyperbolic geodesics exist parallel to a given line, enabling local structure to remain independent even as global correlations propagate. This mirrors how formal systems can have multiple independent axiomatizations or proof strategies, yet remain connected in their logical consequences.
## The Replication and Dissipation of Meaning

Crucial subtlety in conveying a message—melodic, lingual, or formal—is consecutive replication of form of its representation. But after conveying that message and apprehension in the subject's mind, the details of the construction are valueless, and only the underlying meaning, for which it was constructed is carried within the subject. The meaning is extrapolated from the sequence of representatives it is constituted with and the pre-existent perception of something closely resembling. Whereas inference, in probabilistic sense, is definite (as in Dirac-delta of classical ones) only when the subject is wholly aware of the message it is extrapolating the meaning from.

Take an instance of an essayist's mind while he's reflecting his ideas on paper to convey to the mass. The abstract form of the idea somewhere in his mind is first transformed into motor-signals which then manifests in the muscular motion of his hand and gets represented (by replication) on the paper. Since a graphic imprinted on paper doesn't vanish out on its own, that writing now is, at first, spatiotemporally replicates its existence which wouldn't have been true unless the thought emerged in his head, and the decision to jot that down. In the next phase, when reading it, the pattern of graphic sequence of symbols is replicated in the retina of another likely subject and a neural cascade of avalanche correlates that to what he previously had in mind, which if were consistent to what the essayist said, would assert reasonable comprehension in the reader's mind, and thus, another set of replication of message followed. But notice that at this point, the reader, although acquired that knowledge from a symbographic representation, doesn't necessarily bother about the symbols or even that sequence they were arranged, as if it's job is done in that context and what's important now is the essence that particular representation carried within. Nextly, when that reader conveys the matter to somebody, his motor-signals now vibrate his vocal chord which in turn replicates the structure (essence) of that very first idea in the essayist's head in the frequency distribution of nearby air-columns, which is again replicated in someone's eardrum and another process of apprehension takes place, by virtue of reproduction of pattern in conveying an information.

Note that: the replication in expressing a message is straightforward and very minimal imagination can simulate the whole scene in a minute, but replication in extrapolating meaning from message is more subtle and requires treatment of [renormalization flow]. In renormalization, we examine the system from coarse-grained perspectives, where length and time scales are magnified, and parameters change accordingly. A flow occurs in parameter space under such rescalings; the fixed point of this flow represents the critical point—where the system is scale-invariant and exhibits the same statistical properties at all scales. This invariance is precisely the condition under which information can propagate across arbitrary distances: near a critical point, fluctuations of all sizes exist, power laws dominate, and [long-range correlations emerge naturally]. The subject's inner structure, by innate property, is positioned at the vicinity of the renormalization flow's fixed point, enabling scale-free replication of external perturbations throughout its cognitive domain.

Further noticing that consistent evolution of complexity in human language—from spoken Sanskrit to axiomatic formal setup—the gradual increment of unambiguity assures less loss of information when conveyed to another likely subject, with the assumption that he is aware of the necessary conventions of the framework one is choosing; otherwise any phrase is equally gibberish. But the point here is, the tendency towards least-losing conveyed-information is reflection of least dissipative characteristic of such systems which are very close to criticality, and only this enables information to propagate upto arbitrary range. [Information dissipation length (IDL)], measured through mutual information decay in networks, serves as a quantitative marker: systems at the edge of criticality exhibit maximal IDL, enabling coordinated global transitions despite local independence.​

## Consciousness, Agency, and the Temporal Constitution of Self

In the discussion, there's this whole business of agentlessness in consciousness that asserts something radical: a dynamics can only be spontaneously persistent without external control if and only if there exists some physical governance overall to it. Yet this governance is not external imposition but emerges from the system's own structure.

Neural correlates of consciousness reveal that consciousness is not localized but distributed across large-scale functional networks involving the thalamocortical system, the ascending reticular activating system, and widespread cortical associations. Critically, [bodily self-consciousness—the sense of ownership, location, and agency—emerges from the integration of multisensory and interoceptive signals], with specific roles for the intraparietal sulcus, ventral premotor cortex, and extrastriate body area. Yet the temporal dimension is fundamental: [identity and agency themselves arise from the temporal dynamics of neural elaboration], where the brain's predictive capacity—its ability to anticipate sensory consequences and motor outcomes—generates the computational distinction between self and non-self, not as mental construct but as intrinsic computational necessity. ​

The hierarchy of consciousness is not bottom-up assembly but hierarchical integration: embodiment (the perception of body ownership) is predicated upon lower-level multisensory binding, while presence (the perception of being at a location) emerges from embodiment through further integration. Yet consciousness itself—as [integrated information (Φ)]—requires more than mere information integration; it demands reentrant architecture where subsystems feed back upon themselves, creating feedback loops of cause-effect power. The maximal integrated information cluster (MICS) in any system constitutes its conscious state; a group of people may collectively integrate information at lower degree than each individual, so the group as such lacks consciousness while each individual preserves it.​

Gazing at the sky full of stars, at one end I see sparse blobs of cold matter and nuclear reactors and on the other end, I perceive my own state of perception, be it sensory or qualia-centric. I profoundly prefer pondering: HOW? How can this connection be brought in daylight? Where's unphysicality in the emergence of social stigmas from molten magma? I believe it's not even physical in the old categorical sense—that's possibly another categorisation of falsifiability. Rather, it is what it is: a natural phenomenon arising from the same physical principles that govern all complex systems—self-organization, criticality, and information integration.

Whereas another strong justification is that: whatever persists perception (or in fact any biologically orchestrated construction) is the one which caused it to emerge in the first place, thus its ubiquitous abundance can be corresponded to its inevitability of emergence. This is not teleology but necessity: conscious systems, once emerged, persist because consciousness itself—as integrated information—provides adaptive advantage in uncertain, information-rich environments.
## Criticality as the Basis of Linguistic and Cognitive Efficiency

Language exhibits signatures of criticality in its grammatical structures, with salient linguistic levels corresponding to phase transitions in the description of language corpora. The power-law distribution of word frequencies (Zipf's law) reflects the scale-free organization of the language network, where a few highly frequent words (hubs) coordinate massive numbers of rare terms. This organization is precisely what one expects of a system poised at criticality: information can be transmitted efficiently with minimal redundancy, yet the system remains responsive to novel inputs across all scales. 

Power-law degree distributions emerge inevitably at phase transitions and near critical points. Lichtenberg figures—the branching patterns that appear during electrical breakdown—exemplify self-similar fractal structures arising from critical instability. These branching networks, with their tree-like hierarchies and exponential growth, emerge not from design but from the dynamics of threshold-crossing and avalanche propagation at material boundaries. The same principle underlies language evolution: as ambiguity reduces and convention strengthens (analogous to tuning towards criticality), the network of possible expressions undergoes a phase transition, enabling sudden emergence of new communicative structures with far greater expressive power.
## Consciousness Does Not Require Language; Consciousness Requires Integration

Consciousness doesn't require language. Nor does it even require self-consciousness. It is a very elaborate form of consciousness and it's well expressed in academics, particularly certain types of academics who like to write books and like to introspect endlessly. It's certainly counter-productive to a certain extent. Yet the first accomplishment of existence is through self-awareness and recognition within complex adaptive biological systems—the integration of multisensory information into a unified model of the world and self.

What is consciousness? It is the capacity of a physical system to integrate information across its own constituent parts such that the system as a unified whole exerts downward causal effects upon those parts, and the parts exert upward causal effects upon the whole. How does thought emerge and manifest in nature? Through phase transitions in information-processing networks as they approach criticality, where scale-free correlations enable the propagation of information across hierarchical levels of organization. How is a subject distinct from an object? Through temporal dynamics: the subject models its own future states and anticipates sensory consequences of its actions; the object does not. How is there universal commonality within complexity? Because all sufficiently complex adaptive systems must solve the same fundamental problem—maintaining coherence and integration in the face of environmental perturbation—and criticality is the solution that evolution discovers repeatedly.
## Characterization of Individual Mind: Dimensions of Integration

- **Doubtfulness**: The capacity to maintain multiple competing hypotheses and to update beliefs in response to evidence—a hallmark of systems far from equilibrium, perpetually sensitive to information.
    
- **Apparent Independence**: The local autonomy of neural modules and cognitive subsystems, enabled by the infinite parallel geodesics of hyperbolic-like neural topology.
    
- **Integration of Perception**: The binding problem solved through long-range correlations and synchronized oscillations that emerge naturally at criticality.
    
- **Long-range Correlation in Coherence**: The ubiquitous power-law structure in neural firing patterns and EEG spectra, reflecting the scale-free organization of critical systems.
    
- **Ordering and Weighing Possibilities**: The Bayesian hierarchical inference that emerges from reentrant processing and predictive coding at multiple timescales.
    

## What Redundant Form of Complexity Can Become Self-Aware?

The answer is: a system whose architecture permits information integration across multiple timescales and spatial scales simultaneously. The brain achieves this through hierarchical reentry—feedback loops connecting distant cortical regions with intermediate thalamic and cerebellar hubs. The architecture must be neither too integrated (which would eliminate independent subsystems) nor too segregated (which would eliminate unified experience), but poised at the critical balance where maximal integrated information is achieved. This is not accident but evolutionary inevitability: consciousness emerges in systems that solve the problem of coordinating behavior in uncertain, multi-scale environments through the same mechanism that enables language to convey information with minimal loss—by operating at criticality.
