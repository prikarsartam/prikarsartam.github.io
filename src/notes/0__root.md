<h2 style="text-align: center;">Reality is Renormalized</h2>


As we read a sentence we start with the configurations of letters in the words in order, but as soon as that finishes we only internalize the essence of those words instead of their exact syntactic details, which automatically gets ignored. Likewise we can proceed to paragraphs, sections, chapters, books to a library, with innate capacity alone. This process of encoding the essence in a form of larger length-scale, time-scale or energy-scale using information of the process at all the lower scales, is called renormalization. Even though we are far from proving, we can still comprehend that the effect of single electron in determining the viscosity of a fluid can only be comparable to that of a neuron, in the forming of your current perception. 


> [!WARNING] A lot more is known about the fundamental building blocks of this universe, than how they have actually built it.
> Any observed effect is renormalized through the course of physical processes in the mediation of the physical event to the detecting aparatus and then in the phenomenal experience of the experimenter. This mechanism gives rise to an emergent collective unit which can no longer be reduced down to anything smaller.


- How does an irreducible unit emerge?
- What is universal in the way that irreducible part manifests in the complexities of the world?
- How to describe emergence in systems with relevant influences from dynamics across the scales?

> [!HINT] Hierarchical organization of reality. 
> The ubiquitous organizing principle of material universe is that every observed effect is necessarily renormalizable, therefore rendering a scale invariant hiererchy of physical and semiotic forms coherent across the range of scales through space, time, and energy.

>[!EXAMPLE] A scale is a fixed window of conditions, within which any dynamical effect can be exhaustively classified as being relevant or irrelevant. it sets the natural magnitudes of the relevant effects where the irrelevant effects influence negligibly. in comparison with the relevant ones. 
 Under the action of renormalization, every system flows in the `space of all theories`, to a fixed point of two types. One where there is no natural length-scale of correlation, corresponding to a phases of matter, and one where the system exhibits correlations across all its length-scales, uniquely associated with a continuous phase transition. Because the formalism hinges on the behaviours of the attracting fixed points, it does not care about any initial detail. The conclusions are therefore `universal`.  It explains : 
> - what are all the distinct forms of matter,
> - why so many spontanously emerged structures around and within us, are geometrically indistinguishable,
>- what are the most likely cause and mechanism of their emergence,
>- what are the universal nature of their correlations and qualitative behaviours, despite being originated from drastically different compositions,
>- why is the world organized hierarchically, 
>- why we are naturally capable of using langauge,
>- how does a brain perceive the world, both external and internal; and finally
> - why we should not take all these for granted.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Critical phenomena and Universality</h2>

$\text{Correlations are all there are}$. In a general isotropic situation, correlation between two distinct constituents, separated at a distance $\vec{r}$ drops as $\braket{\phi_{ \ \vec{i}} \phi_{ \ \vec{i} + \vec{r}}} \sim e^{-r/\xi}$, giving out $\xi$ as the **length-scale of correlation**. Under the action of renormalization, i.e. by successive encoding of an effect at every scale, every form of material organization *flows in the space of all theories to their corresponding fixed points*, which are *eigenfunctions of the scale-transformation*. Such fixed points are classified as either having $(1) \ \xi = 0 \iff \text{phase of matter}$ or $(2) \ \xi = \infty \iff \text{critical point / the point of phase transition}$.   


> [!TIP] Macroscopic behaviours at the fixed points are independent of the microscopic details of their origin.
> - **Universality** is this fundamental property of material organization where the effective governing physics and the resultant phenomena can become indistinguishable, despite originating from very different dynamics. 
> - In the presence of an large correlation-length $(\xi \to \infty)$ systems exhibit similarity of its forms across every available scale, leading to self-similar fractals that are invariant under the action of renormalization.


Many systems in nature function near their critical points - leading to the spontanous emergence of universal structures that simultaneously solve the optimization for their underlying constraints.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Interplay of order and disorder</h2>



The universe, from its primordial inception to the intricate architecture of conscious thought, is governed by a profound and generative tension between order and disorder. This fundamental interplay is not a simple battle between structure and decay but a dynamic, creative process orchestrated by universal physical and mathematical principles. The grand narrative begins with a paradox: the Second Law of Thermodynamics dictates an inexorable march towards increasing global entropy—a state of maximal disorder or thermal equilibrium—yet the cosmos is replete with exquisite, hierarchically nested structures, from galactic superclusters and stellar systems to the biosphere and the syntax of human language. The resolution to this apparent contradiction lies in the universe's initial conditions and the mechanisms by which systems navigate their path toward equilibrium. The journey from the Big Bang's low-entropy state to the emergence of complexity is a story of symmetry breaking, critical transitions, and the flow of information through systems driven far from equilibrium.

The most intricate structures, particularly life, are not equilibrium phenomena but **dissipative structures** operating far from thermodynamic equilibrium. As established by Ilya Prigogine, such open systems maintain and even increase their internal order by continuously consuming high-grade energy and exporting entropy (disorder) into their environment. Life does not defy the Second Law; it is a manifestation of it, a temporary, localized eddy of complexity driven by the relentless global increase in entropy. This principle is mathematically refined by modern fluctuation theorems like the Jarzynski equality, which connect nonequilibrium work to equilibrium free energy, quantifying the probabilistic nature of apparent violations of the Second Law over short timescales.


> [!NOTE] Every phenomena has its own range of validy and therefore predominantly governed by the relevant interactions within that range. 
> World is composed of the elementary random units but the composition gives causes the emergence of an irreducible unit which can be functionally very different from its constituents.

> [!HINT] Nature is composed of random systems with very large number of units.  
> Often the inherent dynamics yields a separation of scales in such systems.Then to understand its beharior, only the relevant effects can be enough so that a humongous underlying information can be systematically ignored. It simplifies an explanation by identifying the relevant infleunces and then by ignoring the rest. 


Ultimately, the interplay between order and disorder is best quantified in the language of information theory. Order is synonymous with low entropy and high informational structure, while disorder represents high entropy and randomness. Complex adaptive systems, from cells to brains, operate at a critical state often termed the "edge of chaos," which maximizes their capacity for information processing—balancing information storage (order) with dynamic computation (flexibility). The brain, for instance, exhibits **self-organized criticality**, where neural activity patterns (avalanches) follow power-law distributions, indicative of a system poised at a critical point for optimal information transmission and processing. This concept culminates in theories like the **Integrated Information Theory of consciousness (IIT)**, which posits that consciousness itself is the phenomenal experience of a system possessing a high degree of integrated information (Φ)—a structure that is simultaneously highly differentiated (complex) and highly unified (ordered), existing in that precise balance between fragmentation and homogeneity. From the quantum fluctuations that seeded the cosmos to the neural dynamics that underpin subjective awareness, the emergence of order is not an exception to the rule of universal decay, but its most profound and creative consequence.


> [!TIP] Human civilization is the largest form of life in the known universe.
> Of all the organisms we are aware of so far, with their abilities to thrive in their window of adaptible conditions and long-range correlated hierarchies of subparts, `every society is by far the largest form of life to ever emerge in the known universe`.

- Hyperbolic geometry concerns mathematical spaces with constant negative curvature. Structures with long-range correlation cannot be isometrically embedded in Euclidean geometry, but hyperbolic geometry allows a natural ground for representing their innate structure. Poincaré disk model of two dimensional hyperbolic geometry and scalefree long-range correlation in natural fractals, are the main inspirations behind this application.

> [!IMPORTANT] In the world of relentless slops and huge cognitive debts, everyone should try to write more, put together the pieces of their minds, just the way they are.
>  Production of language and the intermittent concepts therein, demands the concrete encapsulation of an abstract sense. The structure of the produced language therefore function as the coordinate-system of our worldview. At the same time, to put together something well enough, one is bound to read more in order to arrive at the right conceptual cues. It engages the mind and creates room to grow an identity. Only through this intentful engagement, we can start to fully appreciate the **overture of life** amidst the unnecessary rumblings and roarings of mankind.         

**Every layer of the social hierarchy is being constantly bombarded by marketing campaigns of some kind or another, to maximize the addicting stimulation of virtual reward.** *It is working out very well because it is systematically designed to target the most prevailing vulnurabilities of human mind.* Therefore the cognitive debt and emotional dependence of common people like us are generating the revenue of those corporations. No other buissness model in the human history had the exploitation of public attention and emotion, within the core of their revenue mechanism. No wonder every corner of the world now, is significantly more unsocial and virtually dependent since social media came into existence.

>An intrinsic model-agnostic measure has been proposed for the response of the relative entropy in a many-body quantum
system with singular behavior at any quantum critical point. Its universal character is demonstrated for an integrable and
a non-integrable model, and proved using renormalization group theory and conformal field theory. Its diagonal elements
being the uncertainties of the gradient of entanglement Hamiltonian captures the variation of fluctuations in the entanglement spectra. Since this response encodes the intrinsic geometry of the relative-entropy landscape it naturally endows a
geometric description of quantum phases as disjoint submanifolds of the parameter space and quantum phase transitions
as the boundary across which no geodesic of finite length can exist.
