Out of the random expulsion at the origin of the universe, bloomed structures of all orders of magnitudes, still continuing their flow as further from each other as possible. But orders emerged in many intermediate scales, where eventually periodicites and collective phenomena gave rise to a very special form persisting correlation that can spontaneously propagate in space and time. We call it the biological rhythm. The symphony still goes on, and will be, for a very good long time. But the types and peculiarities of all things biochemical, that formed in the course of time are stunningly enourmous, spaced across a very large spectrum and with widely varing geological distinctions in their origins.

Cognition is by far the most intricate phenomena of them all, for everything that we can or cannot conceive, is dictated by a mechanism that we are still very far from fully unveiling; yet the elegance of science, mathematics, philosophy, literature, music or culture - are direct manifestations of that. From the dispositions of ancient civilizations to indoctrinated genocides and the staircase of scientific revolutions, cognition remains to be the prevailing scafold, of which we still have no better concrete understanding than a `black box`. Since its earliest emergence, those millions of minds that speculated, or should I say, attempted to cognize the outer and inner world, either strategized a better world for others or weaponized their mind for otherwise. Where do we stand now - after countless colonializations, deliberate pathologies and many waves of scientific renaissance?

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Simple observations on mind</h2>

-> - René Descartes

Observation has a concrete meaning in the contexts of elementary forms of existence, known as a wave-function, in quantum mechanics, and also in a simpler way in classical reality. Here it is important to notice the distinction between measurement and observation. Although anything physical is quantative because it is essentially solving Schroedinger equation at its most physically irreducible core, it is significantly more difficult to figure out the right scale to standardize an observed set of numbers, than to qualitatively classify them based on their relative presence. An observable yields numbers for a phenomena involving a physical matter and the scale to interprete them are already prescribed within the given scheme. However any subjective observation is hardly numerical, except perceptions involving any direct measurement of a number. Furthermore the relative intensities are only registered due to lack of any possible standardization. But any first-person experience within a dream is no less real than that of an experimenter measuring the mass of an electron. This indistinguishability is at the very heart of observation in both objective and subject phenomena, as opposed to the standardized ones, which should be distinguished as measurement only. 

With the adaptations through evolution, came to us the innate capacity of observing what is necessary for optimal survival. As the definition of `optimal`  evolve for a human survival program so does the natural range of observation. That way, history is carried forward through the conditions of every adaptation. But the conditions seldom survive for long, for it is always resolved by the adaption it causes. This continuously creates new rooms for novel improvements.  Observations have been present since the earliest forms of life, as every bacteria has the minimum range of observation to locate food in its vicinity, or a ubiquitous primitive organism as a tree. But the ability to introspect or observe within, emerged in parallel with the conception of language and cultural evolution, while the sense of personal identity solidified through excercise of language and the race of social establishment. 

Not only due to its power of connecting physics across the scales but also of evaluating the universal features of any material organization, renormalization is the junction between the microscopic fluctuations and all the macroscopic emergent behaviours. Everything in nature is composed of a large number of simple and fundamental units where randomness can exist both in the innate nature of them and in the nature of their composition. Either way, there always remains inherent fluctuations in every physical system. But the emergent macroscopic observable may be handful and easily quantiable and measurable. Renormalization makes this possible. **So let us try to understand renormalization using something that all of us are already eloquent in, i.e. language.** Everytime you read a sentence, you start with the configurations of the letters in order, but as soon as a word is finished its arrangement of letters are ignored by the mind and only its essence is registere, in a way that after finishing a sentence only its essential semantic contents are registered, and likewise it proceeds to the scales of a paragraph, section, chapter, book to a library - increasingly ignoring the syntactic configurations of everything at the lower scales. Brain naturally performs this computational reduction to scale up the process indefinitely - rendering us the ability to almost effortlessly comprehend an arbitrarily long piece of language. Let us put it the following way. **Information at the lower scales renormalize into the emergent units at the higher scales**. Although the detail of such physical transformations are dependent on the detail of the problem, this feature is universal in organizing physical phenomena across all the scales. As attached in the following, theoretical physicist P. W. Anderson argued in his article [More is different](https://www.tkm.kit.edu/downloads/TKM1_2011_more_is_different_PWA.pdf) that - elementary units of science $X$ at a scale obeys the laws of science $Y$ at the immediately preceeding scale, leading to the emergence of $X$ through renormalization of the dynamics of $Y$.

- **Cognition** : The umbrella of all the distinct mental functions in isolation or within an unified experience of subjects, either intentfully steered by an individual agent or due to the inherent autonomy of her unconsciousness. The comprehension and production of language is intimately related with the ability to render the intrinsic fluctuations renormalizable, so that a coherent unit of symbolic sense can be processed as an emergent identity.

    - **Perception** : The way a system puts together all the relevant degrees of the outside and inside of itself to maximise the coherence as an unit. Perception is a prevailing factor of all forms of life, and is therefore much more primitive with respect to higher-order cognitive functions like introspection or ability of harnessing language. The spontaneous action of renormalization is at the root of integrating the available information outside and inside, despite the registration being the ones under intentful attention.
        - **Renormalization of sensory information**: Every relevant information of the environment is either **resolvable** by the sensory aparatus due to its **evolutionary relevance**  or **unresolvable** due to otherwise.   
        > e.g. : from the detection of starch gradient in a petridish where a mould, *Physarum Polycephalum*, is allowed to grow to a mosquito bite during sleep and every conscious affirmation of material existence.
	    - **Renormalization of intrinsic fluctuations**: Biological neural network as a far-from equilibrium statistical mechanical system is composed of intrinsic fluctuations over a large orders of temporal scales. In systems with higher-cognitive functions like humans one part of the renormalized intrinsic fluctuations form coherent perception. 
	    > e.g. : Introspection, and other in-seeking mental states.
    -  **Consciousness** : The part of the renormalized coherent unit that is directly influenced by an individual agency and attention. This can be thought of the effect of the renornalization at the relatively small time-scales, instantaneous coordination of thoughts and actions.
		- **Accessible cognition** : Of all possible perceptions, the ones that a mind can intentfully access almost effortlessly.
		> e.g. recollection of a memory, language comprehension or other forms of guided perception.
		- **Individual agency** : Everything perceptible is not attended by the mind, because focusing strongly restricts the window of perception which is eventually registered in memory. The sense of agency an individual experiences could not have originated from the simple activations of neurons, but the richness of their harmony causes the sense of agency to emerge - allowing humans to have willpower. 
		> e.g. language production, inhibition or planning out a mechanism in imagination
		- **Qualia** : The unified experiene of the intrinsic coherence of a subject, or simply the first-person perspective. A brain applies its private frame of reference on any incoming information, renormalized either from outside and inside of it, to organize them for later categorization.
    - **Unconsciousness** : The vast majority of neural renormalization is inaccessible and beyond any agency. However the private frame of reference is generated through neurodynamics of larger time-scales and with an autonomy in constant competition from the conscious autonomy. The healthy brain could be thought of as the minimax solution of such a competition. However there is no agency involved in unconsciousness, and the competition between unconscious autonomy and conscious autonomy seems to vary and **pathologies surface when unconscious autonomy takes over inhibitory signals from conscious autonomy.** Although both consciousness and unconscious plays irreplacable roles in renormalizing, or otherwise more known in neuroscience literature, as information integration, of the available cognitive types - the consciousness can only focus on the keen evolution of a handful of interdependent variables, but for complex judgement, unconsciousness renornalizes the essence more efficiently. It is a neuroscientific fact now that a period of distraction into unconsciousness is better for cognizing rigorous and deep phenomena.
		- **Inaccessible cognition** : The majority of unconscious activity is not pointlike which can be focused upon, but as delocalized correlations across concepts and facts of widely varying complexity.
		> e.g. the role of intuition among experts of every field. 
		- **Intrinsic autonomy**: Philosophers have argued whether unconsciousness is structured as a language and its role in the reaslization of an unconscious identity of an individual, through excercise of language. However, since language already encodes the hierarchy of relevant information of the world and culture we belong to, it incorporates an extensively broad scale of information. Since verbal grounding can successfully attempt to steer the unconscious direction from the consciousness, it needs to inherit the both the syntactic hierarchy of a context-free grammar, and its corresponding semantic hierarchy. The underlying autonomy of how verbal grounding manifests, reflect the independent autonomy of the unconscious.
		> e.g. Internalization of complex interdependent concepts through consistent period of rumination.
		- **Formation of dispositions**: Each private frame of cognitive reference carries with itself a signature of the inherent biases of perceived experience. Generally unresolved repressions, formed from some unexpressible trauma or any other intense emotional strike slowly form the the unconscious belief system, which is triggered at the immediate judgement, before any active engagement of conscious analysis.
		> e.q. Imagine the catastrophic cognitive dissonance of a die-hard white supremacist waking up to realize he was just CPR'd back to life by a Black man's mouth. Such crude or even reasonable dispositions, are formed through unconscious activities at large time-scales in the neural network, which may or may not intersect with the faculty for reasoning. The later is a symptom of some pathology.



This should serve as the guideline for further discussions below and provide the rudimentary distinction of the topics under investigation.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Experience and empiricism</h2>


Empiricism and phenomenological descriptions have been the primary discource in human cognition for a long time till rationality took over the dominant discourse on judgement, in seeking the truth behind anything natural and potentially leading up to the european renaissance. Simultaneously the dichotomy between ontology and epistemology persisted side by side in the major discourses, leading to many fundamental insights and a whole bunch of smooth language games. The commonality between the material process and its cognitive representation resides in the fact that the right explanation must reconcile both. That is why science of often termed as an empirical doctrine, which even though is apparently restrictive, ensures that the doctrine always remains grounded on the material reality. 

For questions involving mind, the situation is not so simple as there are multiplicities in the perceived reality. it is a construct of mind, as experienced by a subject. This makes the unique definition of objective grounding much more difficult within a phenomenological experience. However an average subject, a scientist, a psychoanalyst or a psychotic patient has only one mode connection with the world they belong to, and what is through experience. However, if any rational explanation can be proved to be true beyond reasonable doubt under arbitary variation of the subject, then it can be considered to be independent of the private frame of reference, and therefore, can be concluded to be objective. That is why reproducibility is at the heart of every scientific understanding. This closely resembles the concept of invariants in differential geometry, which are intrinsic geometric properties of some mathematical spaces, that are independent of any choice of local coordinate system. One can think of subjects having such cognitive frames of references, determined by their inner dispositions, and therefore coordinatize a phenomena in within their own worldview. The coherence of empirical experience and sequential judgements are mainted through the conscious and unconscious renormalization of a human brain.


<h2 style="text-align: center;">Search for a scientific basis</h2>


It would definitely be much harder to initiate an analysis from observation alone, even only a century back, because the world wars enforced our scientific, ethical and moral growth to a point where there are plenty of fundamental understanding of the nature we belong to, to begin analysing any part of it, with observation alone. The content can then be analysed through the lens of well-grounded judgement. It goes without saying that fundamental principles of nature and their manifestations serve as the ground for any of such judgements. Still there is and will remain, a plenty of room for heuristic inquisitions on the nature of cognition due to its immensely broad spectrum of interdependent functions with very little understanding of its ontology. The mystery of mind has arguably been the driving force of each one of the greatest and worst human endeavours, while their repercussions gave rise to literature, art and the romanticization of every alleys of life. However all these can at most be the motivation to begin exploring *what is so apparently strange about cognition*, even when it cannot have originated from anything more than the simple laws of nature. Everything is a mystetry till we begin believing otherwise. Therefore instead of langauge games, through scientific analysis only, can we attempt to observe the elementary properties of cognition and all that it encompasses in the most general scenarios.






> [!EXAMPLE] Elementary properties of cognition
> 1. **Unity of experience** : Every instance of a subjective perception is unified together via integration of all the renormalizable degrees within the brain, indicating an existence of globally attracting fixed point of the renormalization within.
> 2. **Spontaneity of cognition** : The innate capacity of cognizing sensory information or having higher-order complex thoughts are almost effortless for a conscious agent, indicating an existence of soft/gapless modes within the neurodynamics, that requires close to no energy to transport information around.
> 3. **Irreducibility into matter** : In general a cognized artifact of mind has can have no bearing with the material universe, causing the emergence of an irreducible collective unit we experience altogether within the humanly **I-language**.  
> 4. **Private frame of cognitive reference** : Every dispositions of subjects span the range of what is comprehensible for her, thereby coordinatizing the perception of inner and outer information to be able to extract essence for optimal encapsulation and further processing.
> 5. **Symbolic encoding** : Entire humanity can reside within every human who excercise language, and in doing so, can have guided perception from other humans separates across the space and time of human evolution.
> 6. **Hiererchy of personal experience** : Details of individual experience ranges from immediate emotion to lasting dispositions, yet their association to a subject is self-similar in a hierarchical way, leading up the unified experience of an **identity**. 
> 7. **Eventual uniformity in social experience** : Although every human beings are unique, eventually the space of all that is comprehensible is uniform across all cultures and demographies - giving the expressive yet relatable power of language through art 
> 8. **Independence of physical origin** : The overall essence of the primary values of every human life is experienced with greatly varying details for distinct human beings, but their essential comprehension always coalesce.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Renormalizability : the physical basis of perception</h2>

Cognition encompasses every mental processes that cannot be reduced down to any unique physically measurable neural activity, but as a representation of so in the *private frame of reference* of a mind. Even though the experts have not fully laid down the concrete definitions of all cognitive functions, I believe a consistent definition along with further clear reasoning are enough to begin scientifically appreciating the intriguing nature of cognition. Let us begin with the **organizing principle of nature**. When the influencing factors of a dynamics decouple into relevant and irrelevant ones, i.e. when a *separation of scale* exists in a phenomena, its description amounts to writing a theory for the effective degrees of freedom within the range of scale they function.  However when a dynamics has infleunces from and consequences in, phenomena across the scales, originating from dynamics of short time-scales, length-scales to scales of enormous orders of magnitude - then such a simple description inevitably rules out many important factors, and thus rendering the symbolic fiction invalid. Since its conception in the $60'$s, the idea of renormalization has become the scaffold of organising physical phenomena across the spectrum of scales. I provide the basic idea in the following because it seems to be the primary scaffold of  cognitive functions as well, and there is no other better and simpler organising framework than renormalization; therefore serves as our Occam's razor.

**Cognition as Renormalization**: Cognition fundamentally operates through a renormalization-like process where complex perceptual data are selectively compressed into actionable information [Information Theory and Renormalization Group Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/0910.2097). This mirrors physics' renormalization group methods: irrelevant details are discarded while relevant degrees of freedom are extracted. The renormalization group and information-theoretic notions of relevance—captured via the information bottleneck formalism—correspond mathematically [Relevance in the Renormalization Group and in Information Theory](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.240601), suggesting that the brain's selection of salient features mirrors field-theoretic principles of critical phenomena.







<h3 style="text-align: center;">Emergence of mind from matter</h3>



> [!SUCCESS] The mathematical unity of information, thermodynamics, and cognition is not accidental. [Information theory and cognition form a single theoretical domain](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/20/9/706), where cognition is the transformation of perceptions into information, and the brain's thermodynamic efficiency reflects its information-processing architecture. Consciousness emerges at the precise threshold where a system manages maximum information integration with minimum energy dissipation—a state of critical self-organization.



**Neurophenomenology**: [Neurophenomenology integrates first-person phenomenology with third-person neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurophenomenology), following Francisco Varela's insight that consciousness requires bridging subjective experience and neural dynamics. Time consciousness—the binding of experience across temporal horizons—becomes the key to consciousness itself. [Both phenomenological philosophy (Husserl) and neuroscientific theory of cross-temporal contingencies converge](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2645498/) on the extended present: consciousness integrates information from recent past and anticipated future into a specious present.





<h3 style="text-align: center;">Irreducibility of mind into matter</h3>


**The Instinctual Conflict**: [In *Civilization and Its Discontents*, Freud theorized the fundamental tension between civilization and the individual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_and_Its_Discontents). Civilization demands repression of instinctual drives—aggression, sexuality, narcissism—yet this very repression is the price of social cohesion. The individual sacrifices instinctive freedom to gain collective security, a bargain that produces perpetual discontent. [Three primary sources of displeasure structure human existence](https://courses.washington.edu/freudlit/Civilization.Notes.html): our painful mortality, nature's cruelty, and the suffering endemic to living with others.

**The Death Drive and Sublimation**: Freud distinguished between [Eros (life instinct, binding, love) and Thanatos (death instinct, aggression, dissolution)](https://courses.washington.edu/freudlit/Civilization.Notes.html). Civilization itself is the product of their struggle. Culture and sublimation redirect destructive impulses into creative channels—art, science, philosophy—yet [the aggressive instinct runs counter to social bonding](https://courses.washington.edu/freudlit/Civilization.Notes.html) and must be either repressed or directed against rival cultures. The guilty conscience becomes the price of membership in civilization, often remaining unconscious and expressing itself as anxiety and malaise.


> [!TIP] Leibniz anticipates modern information theory: consciousness is not a receiver of external signals but a *compressor* of information about the world, available to itself through intrinsic dynamics. [Elements of qualitative cognition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S157106451930154X) formalizes this in algebraic topology, showing that information structures in n-body systems can be interpreted through Leibnizian monadic-panpsychic perspectives.
> Leibniz's [monadology](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/literature-and-writing/monadology-gottfried-wilhelm-leibniz) offers a radically non-Cartesian framework. Each monad is characterized not by contact with the external world (monads do not causally influence one another) but by [perception—the intrinsic expression of the entire universe from its unique vantage point](https://sites.pitt.edu/~rbrandom/Texts/LADP%20brandom.pdf). Perception and apperception (self-aware perception) exist in degrees, ranging from the conscious, inferentially sophisticated recognition of a musician analyzing harmony down through minute, confused perceptions beneath conscious thresholds. Every created being is subject to *internal* change according to its own principle—a principle that [generates all its perceptions from those immediately past](https://iep.utm.edu/leib-met/), not from external causation.



Consciousness does not emerge all-at-once in binary fashion. [Conscious content arises through gradual microgenesis](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5288355/), with formative and disformative stages, followed by dissolution through "anti-genesis." This challenges the idea of consciousness as a static property; it is instead a *process* of temporal integration and disintegration, never fully stable.


 <h3 style="text-align: center;">Criticality and phase transitions of mind</h3>


Recent neuroscience reveals that consciousness correlates with the brain operating at a critical point—a threshold between order and chaos. [Phase transitions in grey matter](https://pubs.aip.org/books/book/80/Phase-Transitions-in-Grey-MatterBrain-Architecture) exhibit scale-invariant properties characteristic of criticality. Conscious states emerge when neural populations achieve synchronized activity patterns through phase transitions in information flow bandwidth [The Easy Part of the Hard Problem: A Resonance Theory of Consciousness](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6834646/).

> [!IMPORTANT] Consciousness may arise not from a dedicated neural mechanism, but from the *crossing of a physical threshold*—analogous to how water transitions from liquid to gas when conditions align. The brain's ability to manage phase transitions determines its capacity to transcend the threshold of consciousness [Laying the foundations for a theory of consciousness](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2024.1379191/full).
> 
**Synergy, Redundancy, and Integration**: Higher-order information theory transcends pairwise correlations to examine synergistic and redundant information structures. [As high-dimensional stimuli impinge on the brain, synergistic computation rapidly integrates unpredicted information within low-level modules](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.02671v1), while recurrent feedback loops induce redundancy that stabilizes representations. The brain achieves global coherence by balancing these dynamics: transient synergistic phases for rapid integration alternate with sustained redundant oscillations that prevent information loss. This balance is the neural signature of consciousness.


 <h3 style="text-align: center;">Context-free language and cognition </h3>


**Language as Information Architecture**: Language does not merely transmit information; it structures cognition itself. In Lacanian psychoanalysis, [the Symbolic Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Symbolic) is the unconscious linguistic framework through which subjectivity emerges. The unconscious, in Lacan's revolutionary insight, is [structured like a language](https://sites.pitt.edu/~rbrandom/Texts/LADP%20brandom.pdf)—neither irrational nor chaotic, but governed by semiotic rules. Language becomes the master architecture through which desire, lack, and meaning are organized, establishing intersubjective bridges between minds.

The structure of the mind appears to mirror the critical phenomena observed in statistical physics, operating as a distinct state of matter optimized for efficient, scale-free information propagation. This is evidenced by the finding that [mutual information in natural language decays as a power law rather than exponentially, a signature of criticality that implies the presence of deep, recursive dynamics akin to context-free grammars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06737); these structures effectively create a "hidden dimension" of hierarchy that allows the brain to bridge long-range dependencies. This aligns with the theoretical framework proposed in [Consciousness as a State of Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1219), which posits that consciousness ("perceptronium") arises from specific information-processing principles—such as integration and independence—that are maximized when a physical system operates near a phase transition. Together, these perspectives suggest that the brain's inherent dynamics are "renormalizable," capable of compressing and encoding the complex, multi-scale structure of reality into a format that allows for optimal information utility and the emergence of a unified cognitive experience.





---

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Evolution of representations</h2>
The framework known as "Immersed Experiencer" posits that understanding language fundamentally relies on the mental reactivation of neural states originally acquired through sensory and motor interaction with the world. Rather than processing abstract, arbitrary symbols, the brain utilizes a process detailed in the paper [Language Comprehension as Guided Experience](https://web-archive.southampton.ac.uk/cogprints.org/949/) to construct a simulation of the described events. This perspective aligns with the proposal of [Perceptual Symbol Systems](https://barsaloulab.org/Online_Articles/1999-Barsalou-BBS-perceptual_symbol_systems.pdf), which argues that cognition is grounded in the same neural systems used for perception and action. In this view, understanding a sentence is akin to a low-level biological reenactment of the scene, recruiting visual and motor cortices to "experience" the meaning rather than just cataloging it. ​
<h3 style="text-align: center;">language comprehension is a guided perception</h3>



Empirical support for this view is robust, particularly concerning the interaction between motor planning and linguistic processing. A pivotal study titled [Grounding Language in Action](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11831821/) demonstrated the "Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect" (ACE), where participants were faster to perform physical movements that matched the directional implied meaning of a sentence, such as "close the drawer." Furthermore, neuroimaging research presented in works like [Somatotopic Representation of Action Words in Human Motor and Premotor Cortex](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14730305/) reveals that reading verbs referring to specific body parts (e.g., "lick," "pick," "kick") automatically activates the corresponding areas of the motor homunculus. Additional behavioral evidence from [Language Comprehenders Mentally Represent the Shapes of Objects](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9280.00430) indicates that readers spontaneously simulate visual details, such as object orientation, responding faster to images that match the implied shape of an object in a sentence (e.g., an eagle in the sky vs. in a nest).​

<h3 style="text-align: center;">counter-perspectives</h3>


Despite the compelling evidence for sensory-motor involvement, the theory faces scrutiny regarding whether these simulations are necessary for understanding or merely a byproduct. Arguments detailed in [A Critical Look at the Embodied Cognition Hypothesis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001002770800067X) suggest that while motor areas activate during processing, this "grounding" might be epiphenomenal, with the core comprehension occurring via symbolic associations—a necessity when explaining how the brain processes purely abstract concepts like "justice" or "infinity." Moreover, the universality of these effects has been challenged by meta-analyses found in [On the Reliability of the Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4662055/), which question the replicability of motor-interference findings, suggesting that embodied simulation may be a flexible, context-dependent strategy rather than an automatic, hard-wired rule of language.​

 <h2 style="text-align: center;">Many doctrines of cognitive studies</h2>

Most philosophers have had the tendency of playing either charmingly extravagant language games for personal intellectual pleasure, or to romanticize their suffering to establish an identity amidst the peers. They have filled up countless pages on the nature of human cognition, in a way that are **not even false**. The key distinction to notice, is what is physically principled and what is insightlessly circular with the sole purpose of justifying one's personal disposition. However a part of philosophical developments indeed aligns well with the scientific understanding of cognition, so far. The purpose of this article is not to give a neuroscientific or physical foundation of cognition, but rather to demonstrate through simple observation and well-grounded rational judgement, that renormalization, the organizing principle of the matter, is the organizing principle of mind too.


> [!IMPORTANT] Kant's insight dissolves the naive realism underlying much modern neuroscience: there is no "view from nowhere." Every act of cognition is already structured by the subject's cognitive capacities. This makes the hard problem of consciousness even harder—we cannot step outside the cognitive apparatus to observe consciousness "from the outside."
> **Transcendental Idealism and the Structure of Experience**: [Kant's transcendental idealism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-transcendental-idealism/) revolutionized philosophy by inverting the subject-object relationship. Rather than cognition passively receiving an external reality, [space and time are formal structures of *our* perception](https://iep.utm.edu/kant-transcendental-idealism/), not features of things-in-themselves. This means consciousness does not mirror reality; it *constitutes* the empirical world through its categorical apparatus. Kant establishes that we can never access the noumenal realm—the world apart from our cognitive structures—but within the realm of possible experience, the laws of causation and temporal order are guaranteed *a priori*.

[René Descartes formulated the mind-body problem](https://iep.utm.edu/descartes-mind-body-distinction-dualism/) as follows: the mind is essentially indivisible and non-extended (characterized by thought), while the body is divisible and extended (characterized by spatial properties). Yet this very framework created an insoluble puzzle: how can non-spatial mind causally influence spatial body? [Descartes' solution—that mind and body form a composite substance with unified causal modes](https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/discovery-mind-body-problem/)—was obscured by subsequent dualism-vs.-materialism debates. The deeper insight is that consciousness and matter may not be two substances but two *aspects* of organizational principles: [mind matter phases](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4771150) suggesting that consciousness is a state of matter—a phase—rather than an immaterial essence.


[Freud identified repression as the cornerstone of psychoanalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repression_(psychoanalysis))—a mechanism that actively prevents unacceptable thoughts, impulses, and memories from reaching consciousness. Repression is not mere forgetting; it is dynamic, maintaining its force continuously. [The unconscious mind contains psychological material that would arouse anxiety if recalled](https://www.verywellmind.com/repression-as-a-defense-mechanism-4586642), and this material continues to exert causal influence on behavior, dreams, symptoms, and slips of the tongue. Neuroscience has validated this: [subliminal unconscious conflict activates inhibitory alpha power that suppresses conscious symptom experience](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00544/pdf)—a neurological blueprint for dynamic repression.



> [!WARNING] Lacan's insight transforms the status of language: it is not a tool humans use to express pre-existing thoughts. Language is the *condition of possibility* for thought itself. Artificial systems that manipulate language without inhabiting the Symbolic—without subjective lack, prohibition, and desire—remain outside the domain of genuine cognition, regardless of their statistical sophistication.
> **Lacan's Symbolic Order**: Lacan radicalized Freud by insisting that the unconscious is fundamentally linguistic. [The Symbolic Order encompasses language and all social representational structures upon which conscious daily life rests](https://www.thecollector.com/jacques-lacan-imaginary-symbolic-real/), including the unconscious itself. Because language precedes individual consciousness, the subject is always *already* inscribed in a symbolic matrix. The Name-of-the-Father—the paternal metaphor—quilts the lattice of signifiers, imposing law, prohibition, and the possibility of meaning. Psychosis arises when this quilting point fails, leaving signification to slide metonymically into foreclosure.



---

 

Cognition is not a computational problem to be solved but a *phase transition* governed by universal principles spanning physics, information theory, language, and psychodynamics. Consciousness arises when systems reach criticality—where language structures desire through the Symbolic, where neural dynamics balance synergy and redundancy, where individual drives clash with civilizational repression, and where perception intrinsically expresses the universe from a unique vantage point. This is neither mysticism nor mere mechanism: it is the recognition that consciousness is how matter organizes itself when complexity reaches a threshold where internal models become recursive, self-aware, and capable of generating authentic novelty. The problem is not how consciousness *could* emerge from inert matter, but recognizing that consciousness is the name we give to matter when it achieves sufficient self-organizing criticality.
