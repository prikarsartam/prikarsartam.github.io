                                                          When ancient problems are known to require modern solutions, how come an entire nation of many great giants impose ancient dehumanizing narratives to bias the modern practices at such a large scale? Every dictatorial hegemony has been based on some simple narrative of supremacy, without which it is always reduced down to unreasonable batons and bullets. Therefore such indoctrinating narratives transform into the main device for oppression. Voices against, are then either jailed or eliminated, and any attempt of the exposure of truth leads to ‘leaders gone rogue’. Those dominating narratives always find their way into every form of crowd, through deliberate amplification by orchestrated media productions, censorship of art, and stigmatization of mass movements. Without a common purpose benefiting the masters of the hierarchy, such a perpetuation cannot possibly persist for long, because only a narrative is not enough to dominate a capitalistic market. Thus the perpetuation has to serve the market as well. But this is rather a modern artifact of humanity. 

  

Likewise, ever wondered why certain changes appear perfectly reasonable and comprehensive to everybody, yet an overarching dogma seems to surround them with an almost immovable cloud which proves quite impossible for one or a few, to break through? This peculiar phenomenon, simultaneously resisting and enabling change, represents a fundamental feature of collective dynamics operating across every scale of material organization. From the intimacy of family systems to the vastness of civilizational structures, collective organization develops its own emergent properties, characteristics previously absent in individual components. While universal remnants of complexity such as the persistence of memory span across systems, most emergent characteristics of collective behavior remain particular to their contexts. So among this vast range of intertwined emergent behaviors, let us focus on the role these dynamics play in normalizing cultural practices and beliefs that become systematically incorporated in contemporary worldviews, particularly those that harm the very populations perpetuating them. 

  

Instead of an explicit dissection of any specific instance, let us first recognise the universal character of every history that naturally prevents any change in its dominating discourses as if it resists any alteration of its identity. It is not merely the history as a causal network of information, rather the long-term biological and cultural influences it eventually exhibits, that constitute the inertia of a history. The purpose of this text is to explore the scientific perspective that, if human society is the largest living organism of the entire known universe, then their history should be as lively as its present, with its own persona and will. Just as the biological organisation of a certain kind leads to the emergence of psyche, the cultural descriptors and dominating indoctrinations become the major representatives of the inertia a history carries. It should be seen as just another eternal war of entropy and structure, but at a much larger scale in both space and time. 

  

Let us start by observing the surprising universality of the transference and propagation of discontent across a wide range of events. Starting from an abused evolving into an abuser, or an abandoned child growing up to be a people pleaser, to the progression of transgenerational trauma in the descendants of the holocaust and other genocide survivors around the world; psychological repressions always find their way to the surface in our day-to-day life, often in more drastic ways than what it originated from. The histories that are carried with them is a concoction of projected identifications, right or wrong; that inevitably shape the way they perceive reality and end up insisting others on the same. 

  
  
  

**The architecture of social memory** : A pioneer of collective memory theory, Maurice Halbwachs, articulated a foundational insight: "One may say that the individual remembers by placing himself in the perspective of the group, but one may also affirm that the memory of the group realizes and manifests itself in individual memories." This dialectical relationship reveals memory not as individual possession but as a socially embedded phenomenon, communication, cultural norms, language, and customs shape both personal recollection and collective remembrance. This is not passive absorption but active co-creation. Memory functions like a  palimpsest, layered inscriptions constantly rewritten and recontextualized by the interpretations of each generation. The past we inherit has already been filtered through countless retellings, each inflected with contemporary concerns and power dynamics. 

  

Such symbolic interactions reveal that individuals do not passively absorb culture but actively recreate it through everyday interactions. Each performance of cultural knowledge subtly transforms it; each retelling introduces minute variations. Over time, these accumulated micro-changes produce macro-level cultural evolution. The choir that performs folk melodies does not simply reproduce the past but actively reconstructs it, translating local narratives into contemporary resonances, making memory newly meaningful for present audiences.

  

**Epigenetic inheritance of historical trauma** : But cultural transmission operates on more than symbolic registers. The discovery of epigenetic mechanisms reveals that traumatic experiences can alter gene expression patterns without changing DNA sequences themselves, and these alterations transmit across generations. Children of Holocaust survivors, for instance, show distinctive methylation patterns in stress-regulatory genes (FKBP5, NR3C1), increasing vulnerability to anxiety and trauma-related disorders. The parental trauma, though not directly experienced, leaves biological signatures in offspring stress response systems.

  

Research on the Dutch Hunger Winter of 1944-45 provided landmark evidence: individuals exposed to famine in utero exhibited persistent epigenetic differences detectable six decades later, particularly in genes regulating metabolism and stress. Likewise, the mechanisms of intergenerational trauma transmission illuminate how historical injuries become normalized into cultural practices. Transgenerational trauma, the psychological and physiological effects that trauma experienced by one generation produces in subsequent generations, operates through multiple documented pathways: psychodynamic (unconscious absorption of parental repressed trauma), sociocultural (vicarious learning through observation of parental coping), family systems (communication patterns and attachment styles), and biological (epigenetic inheritance). 

  

The research on Holocaust survivors' descendants exemplifies this precisely. While direct survivors experienced PTSD, their children more commonly present with generalized anxiety disorder, reflecting exposure not to direct trauma but to parental trauma narratives and behavioral sequelae. The third and fourth generations show complex patterns: enhanced social bonding and community attachment (adaptive responses to collective trauma) coexist with altered stress physiology and anxiety vulnerabilities (maladaptive inheritances). What was once an acute response to existential threat becomes a chronic condition, maintained not by ongoing persecution but by biological and psychological transmission mechanisms.The parental generation's trauma-related behaviors (overprotection, emotional unavailability, substance use as coping) become the developmental environment for the next generation, programming similar stress sensitivities and maladaptive responses.

  

This transmission can masquerade as culture itself. What appears as "traditional" practices may actually be trauma responses that have crystallized into cultural norms. They become normalized, passed down as "how we do things," their traumatic origins obscured or forgotten. Future generations inherit not living traditions but trauma-shaped substitutes, mistaking historical scars for cultural identity.

  

The implications stagger: history inscribes itself not merely in cultural memory but in biology itself. The traumas of colonization, genocide, enslavement do not end with the direct survivors but cascade through generations in measurable physiological alterations. Historical events become embodied, transmitted as vulnerability thresholds, stress sensitivities, metabolic predispositions that shape life chances decades after the originating trauma.

  

**Social Inertia: Bourdieu's Habitus** : Pierre Bourdieu's concept of habitus illuminates why such patterns persist despite conscious efforts at change. Each person occupies a position in social space, defined by social class, relationships, and networks. Through engagement in this space, individuals develop sets of behaviors, lifestyles, habits that serve to maintain the status quo. People are thereby encouraged "to accept the social world as it is, to take it for granted, rather than to rebel against it, to counterpose to it different, even antagonistic, possibilities." 

  

Dominant social classes maintain status and privilege not through force alone but through the reproduction of the very categories of perception and evaluation that legitimize their dominance. This is cultural inertia in its essence: the resistance to modifying established norms, behaviors, beliefs even when confronted with compelling reasons for change. It manifests as collective reluctance to deviate from familiar patterns, the comfort of the known outweighs rational arguments for alternatives. 

  

The phenomenon operates at multiple scales simultaneously. At the micro level, cognitive biases favor existing beliefs over new information, confirmation bias, status quo bias, availability heuristic all conspire to maintain current worldviews. At the meso level, social norms create powerful conformity pressures, group behaviors and expectations constrain individual actions even when individuals privately question them. At the macro level, economic systems and institutional structures entrench unsustainable practices through path dependencies, sunk costs, and vested interests. These levels interlock: institutional arrangements shape social norms which reinforce individual cognitions which reproduce institutional arrangements.

  

**The self-perpetuating reinforcement of norms** : Cultural inertia thus becomes a self-reinforcing system. Existing cultural norms shape individual perceptions and behaviors, which in turn reinforce those norms through repeated performance. Each iteration strengthens the pattern, making deviation increasingly costly and conformity increasingly automatic. The system exhibits what complexity theorists term "lock-in"; once established, alternative pathways become structurally inaccessible despite potentially superior outcomes.

  

This explains the paradox posed at the outset: why do reasonable, comprehensive changes face immovable resistance? Because change threatens not merely specific practices but the entire architecture of meaning-making, identity, and social position that individuals and groups have constructed around existing arrangements. To change is to risk ontological destabilization, the dissolution of the familiar categories through which reality becomes intelligible. The resistance is not irrational; it is profoundly rational from the perspective of actors embedded in systems whose continuation guarantees their identity and position.

  

Moreover, dominant narratives colonize the very terms through which alternatives might be imagined. Language itself, having evolved to describe and reproduce existing arrangements, lacks adequate vocabulary for radically different possibilities. The struggle over cultural change becomes a struggle over meaning-making capacity itself, who controls the categories, metaphors, narratives through which collective life is understood and organized?

  
  

**To put it all together** : The inertia of history is not absolutely immovable. Smelser's value-added theory demonstrates that collective behavior and cultural transformation become possible when specific conditions align: structural conduciveness (opportunity for change), structural strain (tensions requiring resolution), generalized belief (shared interpretation of problems and solutions), precipitating factor (triggering event), mobilization for action (organization and leadership), and operation of social control (response of authorities and institutions). Each condition adds value to the likelihood of collective action; remove any one, and the transformation aborts. The implication is profound: overcoming historical inertia requires not merely changing minds but restructuring the entire social field. Cultural change demands simultaneous intervention across cognitive, social, economic, and political dimensions. It requires disrupting the self-reinforcing feedback loops that maintain existing arrangements, creating cognitive dissonance that existing frameworks cannot resolve, establishing alternative social networks that normalize different behaviors.

  

Most critically, it requires addressing power relations that determine which narratives, memories, and identities become socially legitimate. Challenging cultural inertia thus demands challenging the power structures that determine what can and should be remembered, what must be forgotten, and which futures can be imagined. If human society constitutes the largest living organism in the known universe, then its history must be understood not as a dead past but as a living process, active, consequential, and through its language, shaping the present possibilities through biological, psychological, and cultural channels. The inertia of history manifests as collective memory embedded in institutions, transmitted through socialization, inscribed in bodies, and performed in daily practices. This inertia simultaneously enables social cohesion and constrains social transformation.

  

The challenge becomes recognizing how historical traumas, colonial legacies, and structural violence continue operating in the present, not as distant events concluded but as ongoing processes reproduced through normalized cultural practices, transmitted biological vulnerabilities, and unquestioned social arrangements. Breaking these patterns requires more than education or awareness; it demands fundamental restructuring of the social conditions that perpetuate them.
