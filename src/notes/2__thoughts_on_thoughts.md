Surprising is the fact that whatever apprehension and inference a mind simply makes at each instance, is a perception;
which doesn’t at all have any simple phenomenology. It is to acknowledge with most priority that - thoughts are all there is
in mind, and mind is natural; no whimsical wizardry makes a blob of matter thoughtful and self-aware. For a subject 1 the
world as it is immersed within, seems to have constrained its rigid physical existence, although attributes regarding mind
provide additional degrees of freedom for each state of the subject. the immediate freeness of an individual’s choice of
thought, or the structure of it, if any as it appears instantaneously, allows the independence of choice of action from a
number of possibilities. How does that even manifest spontaneously in an I? We’re so accustomed to the availability of
thoughts and mind that its absurdities and non-trivialities have become opaque to us. Looking at a sky full of constellations,
and pointing towards a moving satellite; it’s profoundly epiphanic to realise, within these very sparsely distributed matter in
emptiness, consciousness exists. The question of how, would reveal what possible phenomena persists it after its primitive
emergence; and the question, why, would address the inevitability of the emergence of thought, and mind; out of the
interactive evolution that might constitute brand new properties from the subparts it’s built upon [1]. By mentioning the
rudiment, simply that - It’s the subject, the self-conscious entities that can make some sense of the word I, who can think
and thinks always.


What is simple and spontaneous must require a finite description length (probably simple) to describe the phenomena;
which is indeed true for events in mind. A perception is real for a individual just like other stuffs around us; the difference is
due to the range of the description length of such processes, due to complexity, that changes the perception on an I-basis 2
. The reality of a schizophrenic clearly differs from me, but it’s the totality of reality that character has. For a body to think, it
doesn’t require external fine control, rather the structuralisation of statements like - ‘what would’ve happened if - ’ although
doesn’t have anything to do with the natural reality outside, carries characteristic signatures of a thought. Further surprise
strikes in the contemplation that a negligibly tiny fraction of the universe can think, and even anticipate about the whole
universe; which is of huge orders of magnitude different in spatiotemporal scale. Also recognition of a naturally formed
system as self and spontaneously doubting the existence of self-ness reflects the utter extent of complexity in cognition.
Think of each state of comprehension you make, the perception is biassed due to the object under consideration, and the
preconceived structure you had in mind until that instance. Although subject, environment and object completes nature,
and interactions of environment-object are pretty understood; the position of subject in natural science, especially as an
observer [2] in physics is universal, but very ill-posed.


There were instances in the universe when there was no subject, consciousness, or mind; but these seem to be highly
abundant over a certain spatial domain at some instance later. Imagine how it would’ve felt for the subject at the first
instance of self-awareness in the solar system. Such a question, although seems valid, wouldn’t lead to anything
significantly insightful but only philosophical wonders to ponder over. The Emergence of Consciousness in an inert
universe, and its characterisations are what this article concerns.


It’s quite natural to consider, processes in brain manifests as mind, and one can then ask about the brain, its detailed
structures and functionalities, but it is not that much relevant in structure and function in mind Consciousness is to be
treated as a critical phenomena; a new state of matter [3] where the details of its constituents (synapses and neuronal
avalanches) wash away under neighbouring coarse-graining. The system is close to the point of a phase transition, and its
criticality is universally reflected in many of the empirical and analytical results, verifying very much the brain at criticality
hypothesis. Scalefreeness of dynamical variables is the signature of critical phenomenon; where I wish to incorporate
thought, as informally speaking, a temporally long-range correlated association of states in mind.


The succinct distinction still pervades between what we empirically know to be real, and what we can logically construct
due to human’s higher cognitive faculty; as Noam Chomsky advocated throughout; not to mention the species capable of
constructing language, apprehending abstractions, anticipating future via theoretical development and containing
magnanimous range of internal expressions (feelings) is only a human subject. But to ask what an expression is for a
particular subject at an instance, is fundamentally different from what originated it in his brain. Thoughts surprise one in all
steps, some opacity hinders me to completely think what you are thinking, no replication, no cloning, or any unambiguous
representation of that mental state, possible. What happens via an underlying phenomena must not vary between similar

natural structures, since they are tied together from their phylogenetic origin, and ontogeny recapitulates it. But what
happens in mind, is not capturable in totality from external observation. Thought never being a static object but a dynamic
association, slips out instantaneously, giving rise to another one. It is present in the motion, may persist, may not, but is
simple and spontaneous.


But where does a subject, a body that can think; differ from an inert substance? It is the doubt, and the apparent
independence of choice which we have regularised in calling the free will. Doesn’t it seem we feel independent of the
environment, the choice of what to think and the consequential sequence of thought, popping in the head? Indeed the
appearance of freeness is real but the freeness is not, as Daniel Dennett prefers pointing the analogy that the role of
money played in societal decision-making indicates how free-will is inexistant in the universe but in the form of an instantial
appearance to a perceptual universe of the subject [2]. The cognizability of the brain characterises the subject or the mind,
as a separate entity from the environment. Wonderous it is that, not a cat, not a dog or a chimpanzee, but us humans can
narcissistically recognize ourselves when we visually notice our physical appearance reflexively. What drives the
acknowledgement of existence to be so vital within this planetary periodicity of cosmic particle blobs? There are countless
contemplative philosophy dealing with morality, free will, mind and subjectivity with endless introspections and fountains of
neologistic jargons, which not only exaggerate the natural possibilities of mind as originated from matter, but also
irrevocably eradicates the simplistic and ubiquitous generic features of consciousness, encapsulated within a complex
adaptive biological system. The ideas of self-recognition, self-awareness and all such reflexive capabilities of mind thus can
be commemorated through the lens of apparent free will, since what can a blob of particles do except follow the least action
trajectory? Freeness is physically too ad-hoc to be real and substantially disposable in the irrelevant categories of
consciousness. Although the contemplation that my deliberate tendency to convey this statement is my personal will, the
negligence of which would thus account for no credible judgement of what I try to convey. This is more of a physical and
neurological issue than philosophical.


Nevertheless, the generic properties the mind and the consciousness innately carry and reflect through the thoughts, can
be interestingly approached when instantiated the whole discourse in terms of Information and sense, to establish
thoroughly that we tend to make sense in the sequence of a thought rather than a nonsense; whereas a nonsensical
sequence of events, when strikes as a thought, carries in its realisation being a nonsense, the sense. The requirement is
that we need to make sense out of the worldly gobblygook; so it’s not that in one fine shining morning an Australopithecus
started introspecting about platonism and be the founder of wonders to ponder; rather such bodies needed to make sense
in playing a movie in the head of ideas and notions, to anticipate the next and comprehend the past, at the present
instance. The necessity of thought has been inevitable in such unsimilar diversification of human cognition. Thoughts and
Mind being the enhanced extension of the body are necessary in order to survive the competition of assortatively similar
forms of biological blobs. Recent works in explaining occurrences in the brain as Bayesian Inferencing, a crucial idea from
information theory; shed light on many relevant yet unrevealed aspects of human thought processes and brain
phenomenology.


Let us look at something of a more counterintuitive but irrefutable aspect of the human mind. Its comprehension and
appreciation of melodic sequences, i.e. music. The classification that there are consonant and dissonant intervals reveals
something intricate about how the mind perceives the distribution of frequencies. An octave being the trivial consonant
interval given a root node, the perfect fifth is the most consonant nontrivial interval we happened to have listened to in
popular music all around the planet. The consecutives are perfect fourth, major third and minor third. The intervals that are
perceived to be more consonant are composed of frequencies of small integer ratios, and listing the interval with
corresponding ratios are as follows: Octave [1:1], Perfect Fifth [3:2], Perfect Fourth [4:3], Major Third [5:4] and Minor Third
[6:5]. Interestingly, note that for any consonant interval, say the minor third, the composition of two frequencies of ration 6:5
exhibit constructive interference at each 30th maxima of the count; thus brain would more correlate the instances of each
constructive interference, the less the gap would be, which is 1 for an Octave and 6 for a Perfect Fifth. This is what
fundamentally forms a sense. A sense is simply a correlated sequence of identifiable quantifiers. An astoundingly
mellifluous phrase makes sense to the human brain and certainly crosses the threshold of minimal appreciation due to the
very correlated arrangement of frequencies. It sounds beautiful not because it has beauty, but because the human brain is
designed to consider those configurations of intervals more sensible than others. Although music and language are not
conceived by similar mechanisms in mind, the conveyance of information in natural and formal language is again the
concern of compactifying senses.


An expression and inference extrapolated via a thought in terms of words in a language captures the senses in the thought
under the constraints of the corresponding vocabulary and grammar. A nonsensical statement as exemplified by
N.Chomsky as: colourless green ideas sleep furiously is clearly an uncorrelated notion when matched with the additional

properties of the constituents; i.e. the causal correlation indicates how sleep and furiousness do not go along usually. One
can further hypothesise with reason, that, the more the correlation the more the sense; which strictly separates the
categories of conscious thoughts and a dream, which is more of a free association of pathological responses.
But what’s the point of all this? Why did some systems evolve spontaneously over a planet and start to think, write poetry,
compose pieces and construct verbal to formal languages in the course of time? Is it just a consequence or is the
emergence of thoughtful and doubtful moist robots an inevitable phenomenon? The way biology defies standard closed
and equilibrium thermodynamic setup, due to being open, dissipative and way out of equilibrium; endowed with tremendous
complexity with hinges of simplicity lurking precisely at necessary points; instructs something fundamental is driving you
and me, at every single instance of our existence. It has been anticipated how emergence of life, evolution, language
conceivence, states of perception are all the part of the big brat; the critical phenomena of complex systems [1], [2], [3], [4];
where the lack of characteristic spatiotemporal scale allows divergence of correlation lengths. Huge range of empirical and
phenomenological works indicate - the brain at criticality - hypothesis to be true [4], whereas state of mind, or an instance
of a thought can be regarded another state of matter [3] affirms possibility of phase transition in complex dynamics of
neurons and other microscopic detailings, whereas the instances of falling in love, falling apart or falling asleep has been
identified to have caused due to phase transition in neuronal networks. But one interesting key feature waits to be revealed.
Whistles, distant signs and horns were the primitive methods of communications which further evolved into symbolic
representations of expressions and further shaped into more and more unambiguous forms of language, in fact humans
now have formal systems where no unambiguous statements are possible. Why this direction? One plausible case to
investigate is to consider the loss of information due to ambiguity of language, which decreased in the course of evolution
of formalisms. From thought to lingual forms of expressions, the continuous replication of pattern of mental state to
sequences of vibrations of air-column, upto arbitrary range characterises the least loss of information or least dissipation
and scalefree information propagation throughout the system; which are signatures of criticality; are universal and
inevitable near the point of phase transition [1].


The unconsciousness is free and boundless for it does not require any bound to be specified in order to exist, where
consciousness is about the boundedness. augmentation - forcefulness in being conscious - maximality of possibilities in the
direction of attention - dim lighted ambience were suitable for concentrating materials more integratedly than havoc
roomlight - the apparent independence in the subject’s mind to direct its attention to one particular detail reveals the
dynamics behind mind. Brain causes the mind.


All of these contemplations and anticipations, about how and why contemplation and anticipations are even possible at the
first place shines the marble of the emergence of subject and a thought in the universe.
