Introduction:

  
The constant surge of spontaneous neural activity that makes a human being comprehend and also in the process, create a description of the world around - i.e. complex decision processes taking place in the brain with corresponding neurotransmitters in a structured harmony - is not conscious, nor any bit or parts of it. Yet anything with sufficient capability of cognition has a concrete sense of conscious awareness and identity.

I want to point to the self-referential aspect of subjective experience, which is something that we can only keep track of - in the sense that, individually, each one can only keep track of his own experiences since nobody else’s experience comes in the way of it or due to many other factors. A way to simply put it together would be, Processes in the body (an extended complex system), altogether, is a neuro-symphony, and the self is the audience. But it is not a simple symphony where you can reduce a pitch you heard in your ear to one player in the orchestra, as if it has its own cutoff of resolution.

A body(=organization) with non-zero identity has a notion of self within it - Identity here needs to be considered as an order parameter that emerges through a phase transition in some complex system ( the central theme ).


Whether anschauung transformation can be considered as a coordinate transformation of the intrinsic coordinate systems of individuals. Consider Preconception is spanned by some finitely orthogonal bases, each of which are degrees of Anschauung where preconception in a human being is his Anschauung as Kant describes. Now my question is - can we interpret the “putting A on B’s shoes” as a coordinate transformation from the Anschauung of A to the Anschauung of B. (but the loss of totality preservation usually in subjective experience sharing fails to meet the criterion of bijection).


A common knowledge from biology tells us that cells pertaining in bodily processes have their own lifecycles and the mass-movement of those cells is always persistent as long as the minimum conditions for maintaining the biological correlation is satisfied, with forever changing constituents. The Theseus Ship problem is exactly this. But for the context of this article, we first observe that actual (biological/physical/etc) and mental (perceptual) identity are not bijective. I will mean body and identity as actual identity and mental identity respectively, throughout here. What is further to observe here is that the identity is invariant under birth-death of the cells that sustain that identity, so I investigate the direction, that identity is the limit of the dynamics that sustain it, such that  the identity does not change when a bunch of neurons die and their alternatives rejoin later on.


abstract notions reside at the boundary of the sensible universe - I am considering renormalisation as the act of comprehension or feature-extraction. Sensory information is coarse grained into sensible representations which then is used within the scope of mind. Therefore there must be a function that maps any sensory-stimulating signal (a picture, a passage, a sound etc) into latent features. There is something like convolution but general in those cases but rather generally plays the role of conformal transformation in the parameter space of the system - abstract notions are the fixed point (=limit) set of this dynamical map of feature-extraction.


We can simply put a bunch of particles somewhere with very simple interactions and can see emergent structures popping up all the time. However the particles or forms of interactions are - the emergent ordering somehow happens inevitably and new fundamental units emerge. Now after the emergence the system arrives at a new phase where new fundamental factors act as mediators of the phase - like in solid -> liquid transition, solidity vanishes (well-defined non-zero valuedness of which characterized that it was a solid) and liquidity pops up (well-defined non-zero valuedness of which characterizes that it is a liquid); where solidity and liquidity are the mediators of that phase. it is important now to note that each phase is uniquely (or at least in the best way possible, in general) identified by such mediators. A solid is identified by the presence of non-zero solidity in it, so is liquid. Now consciousness in this sense has a bit nuanced interpretation. A body is conscious iff it has non-zero consciousness in it. Therefore consciousness is the identity of that body. Therefore by consciousness I will not mean consciousness as generally understood, but as the identity of a conscious individual.

### Need to structure the following content: yet to do


Therefore, following this scheme, we can only talk about your consciousness or my consciousness, but not of all at once. But we can construct a structure for that anyway.

  

A body is an organisation.



Nothing is Sporadic

  

behaviors and all the intentions behind it are biologically determined.

  

From biological reality emerges perceptual and social (real social + virtual social) reality

  
  
  

A subject is a temposocioinnate object



Consider the following scheme: The sense-perception (an element of the Anschauung Manifold), that which is immediately observed in the perception of some being, is embedded in a lower dimensional space (Innate Manifold) 'in a way to incorporate all essential features' (like latent space in latent variable models). Both these structures are spatio-tempo-socio-innate-ly dynamic in relation to the self and all others.

  
  
  

Features are the essential factors that constitute what it is a feature of.

Every effective observation is a result of some conformal feature-extraction process, where the space of all extracted features is the innate manifold. In extracting features of any element of the anschauung manifold (immediate sensual perception), the system factorizes the span of those (=sense-perceptual) elements to find out the set of the orthogonal structures that can tile the space (of immediate sensory information). Our innate manifold is the space of those basic structures, which enable a perceiving individual to create a cover (by tiling) of its sense-perception or Anschauung.




So, fundamentals are those tiling units; which factorize

  
  

Fundamental is simplest

  

Only the simplest is non-referential to itself

  

Any stable complex structure must contain at least one cycle.

  
  

Identity is this abstracted/factored unit, that effectively tiles (covers) the anschauung of a cognitively abled being.

  
  
  

Perception is the effective tiling of the anschauung





Tegmark

- Substrate independent aspects of things → general features.
    
- Very large repertoire of long-lived stable states - can only function as memory elements
    
- One not only needs information storing capacities but also the capacity to integrate information to atleast address consciousness reasonably. Considering the Ising model near the critical point we see the entropy is quite high, as so is the internal energy, which enables the systems to access many different states preserving the information under scaling, which is provided due to the long-range correlation of the activities therein. Therefore it is very keenly indicative that for consciousness to emerge and sustain, the brain requires it to function near a critical point, as only this can provide an explanation for information storing and information integrating capacities of conscious beings. This allows for error-correction in conscious activity, that is it does not explicitly depend on neuronal details. If a neuron dies the system will correctly fix that. (this seems to have a very close resemblance with toric code like systems, which have their own innate (=gauge) ambiguities that are unobservable yet intrinsic to the system). Neurodynamics as a gauge theory?

  
  

Authors/Aspects I need to study deeper:

  

Kant

Lacan - emergence of identity due to mirror stage recognition

Freud - Id, Ego and Superego

Schelling - Identity Philosophy

Niklus Luhmann + Robert Sapolsky - Self-Referential aspect of emergent systems

Unit is the attractor (limit) set of the factorisation map

  

Maybe this can be thought of as a tiling problem, where only wish to only seek for elements which can tile the whole, and those elements then will be considered as the units of that whole.



Morality, religion, metaphysics, all the rest of ideology and their corresponding forms of consciousness, thus no longer retain the semblance of independence. They have no history, no development; but men, developing their material production and their intercourse, alter, along with this their real existence, their thinking and the products of their thinking. Life is not determined by consciousness, but consciousness by life.
