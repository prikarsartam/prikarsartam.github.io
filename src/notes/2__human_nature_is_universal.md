A bunch of particles can flow into the madness of men, get elated in the joy of love, become capable of doubting anything it can conceive and above all, can think or act with an intent. What about this composition, such that the **emergent humanity** is irreducible into anything that can be materially pinned down? We mostly take perception for granted. But the enourmous richness behind its necessity and persistence across time, not only reveal the most elegant clockwork of nature, which is never a clock anymore, **after becoming**; but also begs for the explanation of its emergence from the laws of nature alone. Because there can be no other way. 

Quite often the questions of `how life was`, `how life will be` and `how it is for othes beings` is a natural fixed point of trying think about `what it is to be a human`.  Although the answer to that will eventually resolve the **hard problem of consciousness**, which still is as hard as initially conceived to be, it is a clear consensus after years of philosophical and scientific efforts, that - to experience the effect of consciousness is to measure the intrinsic environment of the brain, which may or may not be influenced by an external stimuli. Mind is therefore irreducible into body but definitely supported by it. The right answer to **what is it to be human** needs to also contain its antagonism, i.e. **what makes someone inhumane**. The eternal interplay of consctructions and destructions of men should be reconciled consistently by the **human nature** only. It is by virtue of the innate capacities and responses due to the surroundings, a form of human life can grow into either a remarkable or a devastating example. Without attempting any philosophical language games we can make a few observations, deduce some insights from our understanding of statistical mechanics, and then conclude about one aspect of the physical mechanism behind human nature, which is general, irreplacable and independent of any demographic or historical artifact.   



The fact that language exists is the evidence that a part of ours minds is shared within the entire evolution of a society.
