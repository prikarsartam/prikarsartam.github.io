Surprisingly ‘I’ happened to have emerged in an Universe full of dusty clouds, fushioning stars and billion kilometre wide black holes at the centre of rumbling galaxies. More surprisingly, however far we’ve been able to look into space we didn’t even find any cup of consciousness, anywhere; let alone highly cognitive entities like humans. Hierarchically, consciousness is an essence of life, in the sense that it’s the collection of order parameters that govern these dynamical bodies. The Ego in Freud’s words encapsulates how it includes consciousness and it controls the approaches to mobility, i.e. to the discharge of excitations into the external world. Therefore the consciousness controlling the external responses of the system, without any additional agent rather by all means, automatically; indicates a feedback mechanism of a self-organised system. 

  

For a huge number of molecules moving around, the dimensional degrees of freedom is unbearably high, rather when looking at a cell or even a cat, one finds a localization of the dynamics, and huge reduction of degrees of freedom. This, by definition, assures the applicability of the concept of self-organisation and synergetics due to Haken, in this very fundamental context. All the developments and evolutions from primitive life to highly ordered societies, have been spontaneous, and again, without any external agent and fully by the environment and the systems response to it. Seems that much high orders have emerged out in space which doesn’t show up commonly but very very rarely.

  

Why then there emerged kingdoms out of randoms? Since the Universe doesn’t seem to be kind enough to calm down and make self-interacting structures. Seems there’s this finite and bounded degrees of freedom in the overall existence that is self aware. How come?

In Generally, either it’s vast emptiness or it’s a highly dynamic galaxy core, with insufficient ingredients required to form order and localise that. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the emergence of highly cognitive systems is of utmost concern here, by underpinning the characteristics of cognition and processes that can spontaneously produce such; but throughout, it orchestrates its complexities to form specifically coordinated multi-functional systems. What about spontaneous reproducibility, probably that’s due to repetition of pattern that propagates information throughout the system, in its self-organised critical state. 

  

One among numerous intriguing aspect of information propagation in nature is its lower-upper boundedness and long-rangeness, within which it exhibits the characteristic scalefree behaviour. Although it requires minimal suitable conditions in order for order to emerge out naturally, once it’s met the system inevitably tends towards its critical state when environmental perturbations propagate in all of its spatio-temporal scales; no additional agent, only system’s self-organising tendency is what’s updating the system, and determining its response functionalities. Indeed criticality is localised but information contained within it, near the critical point, propagates upto a non-trivial range which approaches justification of why and how, natural systems are so highly correlated, or more romantically orchestrated. The scale-invariance shows up somewhere in the distribution; not wholly but majorly for sure.

  

A life is aware of its environment, it responds to it, and it learns from what’s outside and updates its internal self, by the process we call Evolution. Thermodynamically these are open dissipative systems very near to their non-equilibrium criticality which allows information to get propagated scalefreely throughout the scaling range. Clearly spontaneous development and proliferation of such structure must reflect most optimal transportation of dynamical attributes ensuring least dissipation in formation of them. Self-organised systems gain information when subjected to perturbations from the external world, and it updates its internal world and responds to the external world by means of certain feedback mechanisms which we can consider to be information processing of such systems. But life’s awareness or consciousness of the environment is so trivial that even an Amoeba when left in a petri dish with its food, perceives the nutrient-gradient and moves forward to it. One can consider cognition to emerge beyond a threshold of some extent of consciousness, nevertheless every spontaneously feedbacking system can be thought of being conscious; it’s a certain ordered response mechanism upon environmental perturbation.    


Life is a consequence of correlation length divergence near critical point. Indeed it’s so scalefree that miniatural lichtenberg figures in solid insulators, hummingbird’s fluid trajectory, trees, rivers to macro-macroscopic societal orders are renormalization invariant being all in critical states, thus belonging in the same Universality Class. The minimal underlying local dynamics and evolution rules allow these systems to spontaneously approach towards its dissipative non-equilibrium steady state which do not have any characteristic length scale. It indicates spontaneous information propagation upto non-trivial range. Even intuition helps that self-organisation requires feedback from the order parameter to control parameters of the dynamics, which passes on the information about someplace to else. But the underlying evolution has been stochastic from the beginning, and the renormalization flow of parameter space attracted to its nontrivial global fixed point and blown away any information about the system's scaling.
