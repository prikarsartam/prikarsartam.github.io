Crucial subtlety in conveying a message, a statement, a phrase - melodic, lingual or formal, is consecutive replication of form of its representation. But after conveying that, and apprehension in the subject's mind, the details of the construction are valueless, and only the underlying meaning, for which it was constructed is carried within the subject. The meaning is extrapolated from the sequence of representatives it is constituted with and the pre-existent perception of something closely resembling. Whereas inference, in probabilistic sense, is definite (as in Dirac-delta of classical ones) only when the subject is wholly aware of the message it is extrapolating the meaning from.  

  

Take an instance of an essayist's mind while he's reflecting his ideas on paper to convey to the mass. The abstract form of the idea somewhere in his mind, is first transformed into the motor-signals which then manifests in the muscular motion of his hand and gets represented (by replication) on the paper. Since a graphic imprinted on paper doesn't vanish out on its own, that writing now is, at first, spatiotemporally replicates its existence which wouldn't have been true unless the thought emerged in his head, and the decision to jot that down. In the next phase, when reading it, the pattern of graphic sequence of symbols is replicated in the retina of another likely subject and a neural cascade of avalanche correlates that to what he previously had in mind, which if were consistent to what the essayist said, would assert reasonable comprehension in the reader's mind, and thus, another set of replication of message followed. But notice that at this point, the reader, although acquired that knowledge from a symbo-graphic representation, doesn't necessarily bother about the symbols or even that sequence they were arranged, as if it's job is done in that context and what's important now is the essence that particular representation carried within. Nextly, when that reader conveys the matter to somebody, his motor-signals now vibrate his vocal chord which in turn replicates the structure (essence) of that very first idea in the essayist's head in the frequency distribution of nearby air-columns, which is again replicated in someone's eardrum and another process of apprehension takes place, by virtue of reproduction of pattern in conveying an information. Note that: the replication in expressing a message is straightforward and very minimal imagination can simulate the whole scene in a minute, but replication in extrapolating meaning from message is more subtle and requires treatment of renormalization flow (*), where by innate property the subject's inner structure is at the vicinity of the flow's fixed point enabling scalefree replication of external perturbation throughout its domain.

  

Further noticing that consistent evolution of complexity in human language, from spoken sanskrit to axiomatic formal setup, the gradual increment of unambiguity assures less loss of information when conveyed to another likely subject, with the assumption that he is aware of the necessary conventions of the framework one is choosing; otherwise any phrase is equally gibberish. But the point here is, the tendency towards least-losing conveyed-information is reflection of least dissipative characteristic of such systems which are very close to criticality, and only this enables information to propagate upto arbitrary range.

  

In the discussion, there's this whole business of agentlessness in consciousness that asserts something radical, that a dynamics can only be spontaneously persistent without external control if and only if there exists some physical governance overall to it.

Gazing at the sky full of stars, at one end I see sparse blobs of cold matter and nuclear reactors and on the other end, I perceive my own state of perception, be it sensory of qualia-centric. I profoundly prefer pondering, HOW? How can this connection be brought in daylight? Where's unphysicality in the emergence of social stigmas from molten magma? I believe it's not even physical, that's possibly another categorisation of falsifiability, rather it is what it is. A natural phenomenon.

Whereas another strong justification is that: whatever persists perception (or in fact any biologically orchestrated construction) is the one which caused it to emerge in the first place, thus its ubiquitous abundance can be corresponded to its inevitability of emergence.

  
  
  
  

(*): in accordance with my introductory understanding: renormalization looks at the system from a coarse-grained perspective, where length and time scales are magnified, and correspondingly the parameters of the system change. So you get a flow in parameter space of your setup, upon scaling; where fixed point of this flow gives you a choice of parameter which represents a state where renormalization keeps the state invariant, or in other words the system is scale-invariant; and this fixed point is the critical point in descriptions of phase transition; near of which inevitably power-laws emerge (even in self-organised network of human neurons, and many cases regardingly).
