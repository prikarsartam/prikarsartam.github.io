It is a wonder to experience life, all its faces and constant morphology, in association with the civilization it belongs to. Every form of conceivable ideologies, malpractices, beauties and beasts coexist together within the ever-dynamical harmony of social structures, through time and geopolitical disruptions. Human life cannot be elaborated alone without putting it in context of its backgroun civilization. However I am only a theoretical physics student, and I have realised that the organizing principle of material universe, i.e. renormalization, is the organizing principle everything that can emerge and evolve under its own set of kinetic rules. Rather than partculars, I intend to emphasize on the universal and recurring characteristics of every civilization at large, independent of the detail of their microsopic constituents.

## Organizing power of indoctrination

- **Elementary role of religion**: Religion functions as a shared "imagined order" that allows large-scale cooperation by insisting that social structures are [objective realities created by great gods rather than human myths](https://bookfave.com/book/sapiens), satisfying the "infantile" human need for [protection against the terrifying superior forces of nature](https://peped.org/philosophicalinvestigations/summary-freud-future-illusion/).​
    
- **Unconsciousness and 'othering'**: Ideology recruits individuals into subjects through the [material practices of rituals](https://www.literatureandcriticism.com/ideology-and-ideological-state-apparatuses/) —acting as if one believes—while the "god" superstructure facilitates cohesion by directing aggression outward via the [narcissism of minor differences](https://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/165freud.html).​
    
- **Forced power structures**: Throughout history, these collective beliefs have not been voluntary truths but institutionalized illusions used to [make the shortcomings and inequalities of civilization less painful](https://peped.org/philosophicalinvestigations/summary-freud-future-illusion/) for the suppressed majority.​

## Hierarchy of power games

- **Evolutionary conservation of dominance**: Hierarchies are not merely cultural inventions but ancient biological imperatives, evident even in the [neurochemistry of lobsters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05N_aTTzKhE), where serotonin levels regulate status to minimize violent conflict through established inequality.​
    
- **The "Matthew Effect" of accumulative advantage**: Success in social systems follows a non-linear trajectory where [early advantages amplify over time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_inequality_theory), creating a gap where "the rich get richer" because high-status agents possess more resources to risk and leverage.​
    
- **Institutionalized zero-sum conflict**: Civilizations channel the primary [mutual hostility of human beings](https://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/165freud.html) into structured competitions, creating systems where one group's security is necessarily purchased at the expense of another's exclusion.​
    
- **Asymmetry of surveillance and punishment**: Power sustains itself not through constant force but through [panopticism](https://foucault.info/documents/foucault.disciplineAndPunish.panOpticism/), a mechanism of visibility where the few watch the many, inducing a state of conscious and permanent visibility that [assures the automatic functioning of power](https://www.gradesaver.com/discipline-and-punish-the-birth-of-the-prison/study-guide/quotes).

## Civilization and its discontents

- **Fundamental antagonism between instinct and order**: The entire edifice of civilization rests upon the [rejection of the pleasure principle](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/civilization-and-its-discontents/chapter-8), systematically repressing the death drive (Thanatos) and sexual instincts (Eros) to maintain security.

- **Internalization of authority as "Guilt"**: To police these dangerous instincts, society installs an internal garrison known as the [Super-Ego](https://pages.uoregon.edu/kimball/Freud.Civ.htm), which directs the individual's own aggression back against their Ego in the form of corrosive guilt.​
    
- **The "Narcissism of Small Differences"**: Communities maintain internal cohesion by venting their suppressed aggression upon [neighbors who resemble them most](https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/the-narcissism-of-minor-differences/), transforming the potential for civil war into xenophobic hatred of the "almost-same."​
    
- **The psychological cost of progress**: As civilization demands ever-higher standards of renunciation, the resulting [loss of happiness through the heightening of guilt](https://pages.uoregon.edu/kimball/Freud.Civ.htm) creates a pervasive malaise that material progress cannot alleviate.​

## Freedom is bitter in modern world

- **The burden of "Condemned Freedom"**: Without a pre-defined divine essence, modern man is [condemned to be free](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/works/exist/sartre.htm), carrying the crushing weight of absolute responsibility for every action in a universe devoid of excuse or justification​
    
- **Paralysis of infinite choice**: The removal of constraints triggers the [dizziness of freedom](https://philosophynow.org/issues/145/Kierkegaard_Young_Free_and_Anxious), where the sheer multiplicity of possibilities leads to [decision paralysis](https://www.bitbean.com/blog/more-or-less-the-paradox-of-choice/) and the terror of the unknown future.

- **Escape mechanisms and "Bad Faith"**: To flee this anguish, individuals often lapse into [bad faith](https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~degray/CP05/Sartre%20-%20Nothingness-Bad-Faith.pdf), voluntarily adopting rigid social roles or "automaton conformity" to [escape the burden of being an independent self](https://www.philosophizethis.org/transcript/episode-151-transcript).​
    
- **Isolation in the crowd**: The dissolution of "primary ties" leaves the modern individual [technically free but emotionally isolated](https://steemit.com/psychology/@godflesh/erich-fromm-and-the-escape-from-freedom), stripped of the psychological security once provided by traditional community bonds.

> At times of mindlessly rapacious momentum of the large corporations, when industries have already figured out how to tap into the personal vulnurabilities of men to maximise their consumption, elementary values are far more short-lived than they ever were in the course of the entire human history. It is a great time to observe the ubiquity of $(1)$ **all that shines is most likely anything but gold**, and simultanously $(2)$ **all that is loud is most likely lacking the enough content to be otherwise**.

Every life is lived through private frames of references, formed due to lived experiences. But to relieve oneself from their dispositions, in general is to take away ones intertia of identity. However, only being able to see in every possible frame of references allows one to perceive the bigger picture, where everything comes together within one organizing principle.
