Surprisingly ‘I’ happened to have emerged in an Universe full of dusty clouds, fushioning stars and lightyear wide black holes at the centres of rumbling galaxies. More surprisingly, however far we’ve been able to look into space we didn’t even find any cup of consciousness, anywhere; let alone highly cognitive entities like humans. Hierarchically, consciousness is an essence of life, in the sense that it’s the collection of order parameters that govern these dynamical bodies. The Ego in Freud’s words encapsulates how it includes consciousness and it controls the approaches to mobility, i.e. to the discharge of excitations into the external world. Therefore the consciousness controlling the external responses of the system, without any additional agent rather by all means, automatically; indicates a feedback mechanism of a self-organised system. 

  

For a huge number of molecules moving around, the dimensional degrees of freedom is unbearably high, rather when looking at a cell or even a cat, one finds a localization of the dynamics, and huge reduction of degrees of freedom. This, by definition, assures the applicability of the concept of self-organisation and synergetics due to Haken, in this very fundamental context. All the developments and evolutions from primitive life to highly ordered societies, have been spontaneous, and again, without any external agent and fully by the environment and the systems response to it. Seems that much high orders have emerged out in space which doesn’t show up commonly but very very rarely.

  

Why then there emerged kingdoms out of randoms? Since the Universe doesn’t seem to be kind enough to calm down and make self-interacting structures. Seems there’s this finite and bounded degrees of freedom in the overall existence that is self aware. How come?

In Generally, either it’s vast emptiness or it’s a highly dynamic galaxy core, with insufficient ingredients required to form order and localise that. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the emergence of highly cognitive systems is of utmost concern here, by underpinning the characteristics of cognition and processes that can spontaneously produce such; but throughout, it orchestrates its complexities to form specifically coordinated multi-functional systems. What about spontaneous reproducibility, probably that’s due to repetition of pattern that propagates information throughout the system, in its self-organised critical state. 

  

One among numerous intriguing aspect of information propagation in nature is its lower-upper boundedness and long-rangeness, within which it exhibits the characteristic scalefree behaviour. Although it requires minimal suitable conditions in order for order to emerge out naturally, once it’s met the system inevitably tends towards its critical state when environmental perturbations propagate in all of its spatio-temporal scales; no additional agent, only system’s self-organising tendency is what’s updating the system, and determining its response functionalities. Indeed criticality is localised but information contained within it, near the critical point, propagates upto a non-trivial range which approaches justification of why and how, natural systems are so highly correlated, or more romantically orchestrated. The scale-invariance shows up somewhere in the distribution; not wholly but majorly for sure.

  

A life is aware of its environment, it responds to it, and it learns from what’s outside and updates its internal self, by the process we call Evolution. Thermodynamically these are open dissipative systems very near to their non-equilibrium criticality which allows information to get propagated scalefreely throughout the scaling range. Clearly spontaneous development and proliferation of such structures must reflect most optimal transportation of dynamical attributes ensuring least dissipation in formation of them. Self-organised systems gain information when subjected to perturbations from the external world, and it updates its internal world and responds to the external world by means of certain feedback mechanisms which we can consider to be information processing of such systems. But life’s awareness or consciousness of the environment is so trivial that even an Amoeba when left in a petri dish with its food, perceives the nutrient-gradient and moves forward to it. One can consider cognition to emerge beyond a threshold of some extent of consciousness, nevertheless every spontaneously feedbacking system can be thought of being conscious; it’s a certain ordered response mechanism upon environmental perturbation.    

The Subject or the Observer carries the underlying dynamics of information perceivence in the core of its origin. Its consistent interaction with the environment allows it to learn what’s on the outside and as Friston has argued, minimise the surprise at each instance of existence. The extreme reduction of independent degrees of freedom decreases the synergetic components of the system, but abstracting the interaction in a more complex fashion. 

  

Very precise coordination between constituents of a biological system gives rise to its long term existence. Just a healthy heart, or a perfect kidney has nothing to do with the whole body unless all of the remaining parts are well-fit at their places. From energy harvesting from the environment, internal energy production, inferencing to discharge the excitations into the external world requires thorough correlation between the parts of the system, since evolution optimally created the passage where these dynamics can occur spontaneously with precise balance of functionalities and synchronicity. It’s not specific, but extremely ubiquitous in the sense that each and every biological mechanism is a highly correlated phenomenon. They indeed have suitable feedback mechanisms, which use messages in terms of electrochemical signals (bioinformation) to talk within each other, or at least communicate centrally. But the system, environment, self-organisation in Haken’s synergetic sense, long-range information propagation and feedback control falls in very generally only in electrochemical context, where one can surely model minimal dynamics where all features emerge out in the critical point. 

  

Elementary act of observer participancy - subject is the observer - observer observes an object - observer and object are sunk in the same environment and always being bombarded by information from the external world.

  

Objects are simple - observer observes an object - the observation is complicated [in the sense, there's irreproducibility of an event both in terms of statistical configuration or a quantum state; also several observers might disagree with the result of the same experimental setup]. So the origin of complicacy must originate either in the observer's participancy or in the observer's perception of the information about the object.

  

perception is a semantic information 

  

The standard approach to evolution empirically justifies, or rather fits the pieces of evolutionary evidences, with possible optimality reasonings [I require reading it first, which I lack, but have that heuristic picture], but never ever mentions how such spontaneous self-organisation is inevitable under very minimal constraints. I don't much care about how the horse-foot changed its anatomy, or how the giraffe obtained its long neck, rather where lies the notion of introspection, realisation, epiphany under the picture in a dynamics, seems more intriguing. SInce I am just naively trying to discard biology (-cal details) when talking about something more abstract than biology but belongs within so, just to point that - biological, huge scale coordination, including perception and attention is an irrefutable property of a system at its critical point. 

  

Although we can argue whether one can design an analogous experiment as Turing Test, where the examiner is required to conclude whether, depending on the responses of the examinee, something is self-aware or not; and even straight intuition indicates - either something is self-aware, or not and none in the middle. But if unaware objects make up an aware structure, how'd one ask where that additional symmetry of awareness emerged ! 

  

It's again very surprising that this question -  was there a first instance of self-awareness in the flora-fauna evolution on this planet? If so, how did it feel? - doesn't have any answer since there isn't any sharp quantity that characterises the spectrum of unawareness to awareness in any complexity. 

  

But the validity of this question remains intact due to; 

(1) aware structures were absent in the beginning, 

(2) at some point, aware structures are overflowing, and spontaneously proliferating, and  

(3) No external agent governed the transition, anywhere, anytime. 

  

Then either there was indeed this binary transition from unaware dynamics to an aware one, which would then validate a particular instance of introspection of selfness for the first time; or, there was gradual build-up of awareness. and some critical value determining enough awareness to reflect back. Trillions of living organisms are aware, but only one species is self-aware. How much awareness do you need then to be self-aware? Like a matter of from Being (unaware) to Becoming (aware). But this inhibits us from questioning any sharp point of first instance of the kind mentioned above. Nevertheless it's a matter to ponder with wonder.
